<div class="salute csc">Dear Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_2">&#x2014;Not expecting to have the pleasure of seeing you again before you leave the country, I inclose you an order on the inspectors at Shockoe for two hhds of tobo. which I consign to you, and give you also the trouble of shipping as I am too far from the spot to do it myself. They are to be laid out in the purchase of the articles on the back hereof. You will observe that part of these articles (such as are licensed by the association) are to be sent at any event. Another part (being prohibited) are only to be sent if the tea act should be repealed before you get home; if it is not, you will observe a third class to be sent instead of those which are prohibited. I am not without expectation that the repeal may take place. I believe the parliament want nothing but a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>4<span class="bracket">]</span></span> colorable motive to adopt this measure. The conduct of our brethren of New York affords them this. You will observe by my invoice that I have supposed my tobo. to clear me &#xA3;50. sterl. per hhd; should it be less, dock the invoice of such articles as you think I may get in the country.&#x2014;In consequence of your recommendation I wrote to Waller last June for &#xA3;45 sterl. worth of books inclosing him a bill of exchange to that amount. Having written to Benson Pearson for another parcel of nearly the same amount, I directed him to purchase them also of Waller. I acquainted both of the necessity of my situation brought on by the unlucky loss of my library, and pressed them most earnestly to lose not a day in sending them; yet I have heard not a tittle from either gentlemen.&#x2014;I mentioned to you that I had become one of several securities for a gentleman of my acquaintance lately engaged in trade. I hope and indeed hear he is doing very well; I would not therefore take any step to wound his credit; but as far as it can possibly be done without affecting that, I must beg you to have me secured. It can surely do no mischief to see that his remittances are placed to the credit of the money for which we stand engaged, and not of any new importations of goods made afterwards. I must rely entirely on your friendly assistance in the matter, which I assure you gives me concern, as should my friend prove unsuccessful, (and ill foe. may render any person unsuccessful,) it might sweep away the whole of my little fortune.&#x2014;I must once more trouble you for my friend Ogilvie. The commissary promised to write <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>5<span class="bracket">]</span></span> in his favor to the bishop by Neeks. I did not see his letter, and with this gentleman I believe no farther than I see. I wrote by the same opportunity to Ogilvie and apprised him of the commissary&#x2019;s engagement. Should your route to the ship be thro&#x2019; Wms.burgh I would trouble you to know whether he has in truth written or not. The inclosed letter to Ogilvie you will please to deliver with our most earnest advice that he lose not a day in coming over.&#x2014;One farther favor and I am done; to search the Herald&#x2019;s office for the arms of my family. I have what I have been told were the family arms, but on what authority I know not. It is possible there may be none. If so, I would with your assistance become a purchaser, having Sterne&#x2019;s word for it that a coat of arms may be purchased as cheap as any other coat.&#x2014;The things I have desired you to purchase for me I would beg you to hasten, particularly the Clavichord, which I have directed to be purchased in Hamburgh, because they are better made there, and much cheaper. Leave me a line before you go away with instructions how to direct to you.</p>

<div class="salute csc">Dear Ogilvie,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_3">&#x2014;I wrote you a line from Wmsburgh last October; but lest that may have miscarried I take this oppty of repeating what was material in that. On receipt of your letter (and, oh <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>6<span class="bracket">]</span></span> shame! of your only letter) of March 28, 1770, which came not to hand till August we took proper measures for prevailing on the commissary to withdraw his opposition. But lest you should be uneasy in your situation in the mean time I directed mr T. Adams by the means of his partners Perkins and Brown to let you know they would answer any calls from you. In this your friend mr Walker insisted on joining me. In October I transmitted to the commissary a certificate of your conduct in life, on which he promised to write in your favor by Neeks, and tho I did not see the letter I expect he did. By the same oppty I wrote to you inclosing a duplicate of the certificate of which you might avail yourself if the commissary should fail us again. About the same time I wrote from Wmsburgh to a gentleman of the vestry in Orange to secure for you a vacancy which had happened in that parish by the death of Martin. I have had no answer, but the parish is still vacant, which gives me hopes it is kept for you. Mr Maury incumbent in Fredericksville parish (of which I was when you were here) has a tempting offer from another quarter. I know not whether he will accept of it. If he should we shall do for you all that can be done in your absence. But for god&#x2019;s sake let not that be a moment longer than is of absolute necessity. Your settlement here would make your friends happy, &amp; I think would be agreeable to yourself. Your Dulcinea is in health. Her brother T. Strachan is settled with Y. Walker for life. Another reason for her and you to wish for a residence with us. He is wishing to take to himself a wife; and nothing obstructs <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>7<span class="bracket">]</span></span> it but the unfeeling temper of a parent who delays, perhaps refuses to approve her daughter&#x2019;s choice. I too am in that way; and have still greater difficulties to encounter not from the forwardness of parents, nor perhaps want of feeling in the fair one, but from other causes as unpliable to my wishes as these. Since you left us I was unlucky enough to lose the house in which we lived, and in which all it&#x2019;s contents were consumed. A very few books, two or three beds &amp;c were with difficulty saved from the flames. I have lately removed to the mountain from whence this is dated, and with which you are not unacquainted. I have here but one room, which, like the cobblers, serves me for parlour for kitchen and hall. I may add, for bedchamber and study too. My friends sometimes take a temperate dinner with me and then retire to look for beds elsewhere. I have hope however of getting more elbow room this summer. But be this as may happen, whether my tenements be great or small, homely or elegant they will always receive you with a hearty welcome. If any thing should obstruct your setting out immediately for Virginia I would beg the favor of you to send the things I asked of you to purchase by some careful captain coming on James river. Such of them as were for my buildings, or for house keeping I am particularly in want of. Nothing material occurs relative to the health and fortunes of your friends here. They are well in both as far as I can recollect them. I conclude my epistle with every wish for your felicity which friendship can inspire. Adieu and believe me to be yours sincerely,</p>

For this purpose a copy of the bill should be transmitted them. The answer must be sworn to before some justice of the peace, &amp; that he is such must be certified under the seal of their province. As soon as I shall receive the answer immediate care shall be taken to send a commission for the examination of any witnesses Messrs.

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_20">&#x2014;As it was somewhat doubtful when you left the country how far my little invoice delivered you might be complied with till we should know the fate of the association,<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_007" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_007_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> I desired you to withhold purchasing the things till you should hear farther from me. The day appointed for the meeting of the associates is not yet arrived; however from the universal sense of those who are likely to attend, it seems reduced to a certainty that the restrictions will be taken off everything but the dutied articles. I will therefore venture to desire that branch of my invoice may be complied with in which were some shoes and other prohibited articles; since if contrary to our expectations the restrictions should be continued, I can store, or otherwise dispose of them as our committees please. I must alter one article in the invoice. I wrote therein for a Clavichord. I have since seen a Forte-piano and am charmed with it. Send me this instrument then instead of the Clavichord: let the case be of fine mahogany, solid, not veneered, the compass from Double G. to F. in alt, a plenty of spare strings; and the workmanship of the whole very handsome and worthy the acceptance of a lady for whom I intend it. I must add also &#xBD; doz pr India cotton stockings for myself @ 10/ sterl pr pair, &#xBD; doz pr best white silk do.; and a large umbrella with brass ribs, covered with green silk, and neatly finished. By this <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>12<span class="bracket">]</span></span> change of the Clavichord into a Forte-piano and addition of the other things, I shall be brought in debt to you, to discharge which I will ship you of the first tobacco I get to the warehouse in the fall. I expect by that time, and also from year to year afterwards, I must send you an invoice, with tobacco, somewhat enlarged, as I have it in prospect to become more regularly a pater-familias.&#x2014;I desired the favor of you to procure me an architect. I must repeat the request earnestly, and that you will send him in as soon as you can.&#x2014;I shall conclude with one petition: that you send me the articles contained in my invoice and written for above as soon as you receive this, as I suppose they may be bought ready made; and particularly the Forte-piano, for which I shall be very impatient. By this means I may get them in Octob., which will prevent my being obliged to purchase as I must do if they do not come in time.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_21">I sat down with a design of executing your request to form a catalogue of books to the amount of about 50 lib. sterl. But could by no means satisfy myself with any partial choice I could make. Thinking therefore it might be as agreeable to you I have framed such a general collection as I think you would wish and might in time find convenient to procure. Out of this you will chuse for yourself to the amount you mentioned for the present year and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>13<span class="bracket">]</span></span> may hereafter as shall be convenient proceed in completing the whole. A view of the second column in this catalogue would I suppose extort a smile from the face of gravity. Peace to its wisdom! Let me not awaken it. A little attention however to the nature of the human mind evinces that the entertainments of fiction are useful as well as pleasant. That they are pleasant when well written every person feels who reads. But wherein is its utility asks the reverend sage, big with the notion that nothing can be useful but the learned lumber of Greek and Roman reading with which his head is stored?</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_22">I answer, everything is useful which contributes to fix in the principles and practices of virtue. When any original act of charity or of gratitude, for instance, is presented either to our sight or imagination, we are deeply impressed with its beauty and feel a strong desire in ourselves of doing charitable and grateful acts also. On the contrary when we see or read of any atrocious deed, we are disgusted with it&#x2019;s deformity, and conceive an abhorence of vice. Now every emotion of this kind is an exercise of our virtuous dispositions, and dispositions of the mind, like limbs of the body acquire strength by exercise. But exercise produces habit, and in the instance of which we speak the exercise being of the moral feelings produces a habit of thinking and acting virtuously. We never reflect whether the story we read be truth or fiction. If the painting be lively, and a tolerable picture of nature, we are thrown into a reverie, from which if we awaken it is the fault of the writer. I appeal to every reader of feeling and sentiment <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>14<span class="bracket">]</span></span> whether the fictitious murther of Duncan by Macbeth in Shakespeare does not excite in him as great a horror of villany, as the real one of Henry IV. by Ravaillac as related by Davila? And whether the fidelity of Nelson and generosity of Blandford in Marmontel do not dilate his breast and elevate his sentiments as much as any similar incident which real history can furnish? Does he not in fact feel himself a better man while reading them, and privately covenant to copy the fair example? We neither know nor care whether Lawrence Sterne really went to France, whether he was there accosted by the Franciscan, at first rebuked him unkindly, and then gave him a peace offering: or whether the whole be not fiction. In either case we equally are sorrowful at the rebuke, and secretly resolve <span class="ital">we</span> will never do so: we are pleased with the subsequent atonement, and view with emulation a soul candidly acknowleging it&#x2019;s fault and making a just reparation. Considering history as a moral exercise, her lessons would be too infrequent if confined to real life. Of those recorded by historians few incidents have been attended with such circumstances as to excite in any high degree this sympathetic emotion of virtue. We are therefore wisely framed to be as warmly interested for a fictitious as for a real personage. The field of imagination is thus laid open to our use and lessons may be formed to illustrate and carry home to the heart every moral rule of life. Thus a lively and lasting sense of filial duty is more effectually impressed on the mind of a son or daughter by reading King Lear, than by all the dry volumes of ethics, and divinity <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>15<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that ever were written. This is my idea of well written Romance, of Tragedy, Comedy and Epic poetry.&#x2014;If you are fond of speculation the books under the head of Criticism will afford you much pleasure. Of Politics and Trade I have given you a few only of the best books, as you would probably chuse to be not unacquainted with those commercial principles which bring wealth into our country, and the constitutional security we have for the enjoiment of that wealth. In Law I mention a few systematical books, as a knowledge of the minutiae of that science is not necessary for a private gentleman. In Religion History, Natural philosophy, I have followed the same plan in general,&#x2014;But whence the necessity of this collection? Come to the new Rowanty, from which you may reach your hand to a library formed on a more extensive plan. Separated from each other but a few paces the possessions of each would be open to the other. A spring centrically situated might be the scene of every evening&#x2019;s joy. There we should talk over the lessons of the day, or lose them in music, chess or the merriments of our family companions. The heart thus lightened our pillows would be soft, and health and long life would attend the happy scene. Come then and bring our dear Tibby with you, the first in your affections, and second in mine. Offer prayers for me too at that shrine to which tho&#x2019; absent I pray continual devotions.<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_008" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_008_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> In every scheme of happiness she is placed in the foreground of the picture, as the principal figure. Take <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>16<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that away, and it is no picture for me. Bear my affections to Wintipock clothed in the warmest expressions of sincerity; and to yourself be every human felicity. Adieu.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_23">I was of counsel for the libellant also, and though I thought the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the court established <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>17<span class="bracket">]</span></span> beyond a doubt, yet I conceived it did not follow thence that they might deprive the defendant of his parish, because visitation and deprivation are no parts of the office of an ecclesiastical judge. To prove this it was proposed,</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_24">To enquire into the first establishment of Christian churches in Great Britain;</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_25">To develope their several kinds and constitutions;</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_26">To see who is entrusted with their care and visitation; and to apply the principles which this enquiry would evolve to the parochial churches of our own country.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_27">On the first introduction of Christianity into Great Britain, it is certain there were no parochial divisions. The bishops and their clergy lived in common, and occasionally sent out itinerant preachers, to those places where the people seemed disposed to receive them. But when the number of converts became considerable, and the tract of country they occupied extensive, this occasional mission was found inconvenient, and a division into districts or parishes took place. This is supposed by some to have been in the time of Archbishop Honorius, anno 636. But Mr. Selden and others think it of later origin. It is not pretended that this division was then made, as it now remains, into small parishes: it is probable that at first they were few and large, till time and the progress of conversion, made it necessary to divide and subdivide them. 3 Burn&#x2019;s <span class="ital">Eccles. Law,</span> 58.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_28">The King, his great Lords and thanes, for the accommodation of their tenants, having built churches on their manors, obliged their tenants to pay tythes <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>18<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to these churches: for though a law of Ethelwolf, so early as the year 854 (Hume&#x2019;s <span class="ital">History of England</span>) had given tythes to the clergy, yet it left the people at liberty to pay them where and to whom they pleased; a grievance to the drones among the ecclesiastics, not entirely rectified till a law of King Edgar, c. 1. obliged them to pay them to the mother church of the parish. &#x201C;<span class="ital">Debtur omnes decim&#xE6; primari&#xE6;, ecclesi&#xE6;,</span> and <span class="ital">quam parochia pertinet.</span>&#x201D; 1. Bl. 112. The church being situated then on the soil of the lord, being built by himself, and the tythes paid from his tenements and tenants, gave him a natural right to employ any clerk for the celebration of divine service, whom he should choose. 1 Inst. 119. b. The same circumstances would give him a right to remove the clerk whenever he should become deficient in duty. Hence arose the rights of <span class="ital">donation,</span> or the disposition of church livings, by laymen. 1 Bl. 111. Gibs. 819. Watson c. 15.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_29">In process of time, however, an encroachment was made by the bishops, on some of the lay patrons who possessed churches of the donative kind. They insisted, and in some instances prevailed on the patron, to give the bishop a right of previously examining the person to whom the church was to be given. For this purpose the patron was to present him to the bishop, who on examination admitted him able, and instituted him into the cure, or refused him altogether; and a maxim was soon established of &#x201C;once presentative and always presentative.&#x201D; 1 Inst. 344. a. This innovation is said by Selden, to have been introduced by that pious saint and martyr Thomas <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>19<span class="bracket">]</span></span> &#xE0; Becket, in the time of Henry II. Seld. tyth. c. 12. But Lord Coke, seems to think that it was not done till the time of Pope Innocent III., which was in the reign of our John. 3. Inst. 201. And thus was introduced a second class of churches distinguished by the name of <span class="ital">presentatives.</span></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_30">Of the residue of the parishes, after the donatives and presentatives were taken off, the bishops and clergy still retained the care, and appointed persons to officiate at the several churches. These churches, they doubtless, sometimes built themselves, and sometimes procured leave to convert the old British temples into Christian churches, and so may, in some degree be considered as the founders of them. 3. Bum. E. L. 59. Light as this foundation was, it gave them some color for <span class="ital">collating</span> the clerk, and this having been exercised by them from the infancy of Christianity, has acquired the force of immemorial custom, and given reality to the right now known by the name of <span class="ital">collation.</span> So that at present, churches are comprehended as Dr. Blackstone rightly says, under the classes of <span class="ital">donatives, presentatives</span> and <span class="ital">collatives.</span> 2 Bl. 22. Donatives are those churches originally founded and endowed by the crown or lay subject, or perhaps by both, which lie merely in the gift of the lay patron, whose deed of donation is an absolute investiture of the clerk, without presentation to the bishop or any other ceremony. Presentatives are churches originally founded in the same manner by a lay patron, and which, though at first, donatives, were by encroachment by the bishops subjected to presentation to them for their examination, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>20<span class="bracket">]</span></span> admission, or refusal. The reasons of refusal, are, however, examinable by the temporal courts on an action of <span class="ital">Quare impedit,</span> if brought by the patron. 2 Inst. 631. Collatives are those remnants of the old parishes, left after the King and great men had taken off their manors, the right of collating to which, is by immemorial custom, vested in the bishop. Of the donative and presentative church, the lay founder is patron; a right acquired by the acts of foundation (<span class="ital">fundi-datio</span>) and endowment (<span class="ital">donatio</span>). Of the collative church the bishop is patron, because he is <span class="ital">quasi</span> the founder of that, having built it himself, or been principally instrumental in procuring it to be built, or applied to the purpose of religion. See 1 Bl. 111, 112, 113. 2 Bl. 21, 22, 23, 25. 3 Inst. 201.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_31">Having investigated the nature of the several kinds of churches and shewn the origin of the rights of patronage, it remains to enquire what these rights are. 1st. Nomination, or the right of naming the clerk. 2nd. Donation or induction, which is the investing with actual possession. 3rd. Visitation, which is the superintending his conduct after he is in possession. The latter is the object of the present enquiry; as it includes deprivation; which is only one of the higher degrees of punishment exercisable by the visitor. So said my Lord Holt, in the case of the Bishop of St Davids <span class="ital">v.</span> Lucy. Salk. 134. &#x201C;By allowing his power to visit, all is admitted; for he that may visit, may deprive as well as censure, these being but several degrees of ecclesiastical punishment, and by the 26 Henry VIII., and the 1 El. c. 1. the only power given to the ecclesiastical commissioners was to visit <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>21<span class="bracket">]</span></span> without a word of deprivation, yet they were always allowed a power to deprive.&#x201D; So that the visitor of the church, whoever he be, is the person empowered to deprive the incumbent. With respect therefore to the right of visitation, as it is one of the rights of patronage arising from foundation and endowment, so it will, in general, be found coupled with them. Thus in collative churches, the bishop alone visits, he having, in some degree, been the founder of the church. In a donative church, the patron is visitor, because he originally founded the church, and so its constitution is the work of his hands; a point which I shall presently incontestably prove. In presentative churches indeed, the right of continuing to superintend, or in other words to visit, seems to have been encroached on, when the right of approving the nominee was first acquired to the bishop. 1 Mod. 12. It might, perhaps, be thought that if the bishop was the proper person to judge of the fitness of the clerk, he would be the proper person to judge also how long that fitness continued. But whatever may be the cause why the presentative church varies, in this instance, from the general rule, &#x201C;that the right of visitation follows the foundation,&#x201D; is immaterial, because it will be shown that our churches are donatives, to the visitation of which, therefore, I shall confine my future enquiries. Lord Holt, in his argument in the case of Philips <span class="ital">v.</span> Bury, Holt&#x2019;s Rep. 724, expressed himself in these words: &#x201C;But private and particular corporations for charity, founded and endowed by private persons, are subject to the private government of those who erect them; and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>22<span class="bracket">]</span></span> therefore if there be no visitor appointed by the founder, I am of opinion that the law doth appoint the founder and his heirs to be visitors. The founder and his heirs are patrons, and not to be guided by the common known laws of the kingdom. But such corporations are, as to their own affairs, to be governed by the particular laws and constitutions assigned by the founder. It was said, the common law doth not appoint a visitation at all; I am of another opinion; the law doth, in defect of a particular appointment, make the founder visitor; if he is silent during his own time, the right will descend to his heirs. Yelv. 65. and 2 Cro. 60. So 8 Edward III., 70 and 8 Ass. 29. So that patronage and visitation are necessary consequences, one upon another. For this visitorial power was not introduced by any canons or constitutions ecclesiastical; it is an appointment of law; it arises from the property which the founder had in the lands assigned to support the charity; and so he is the author of the charity; the law gives him and his heirs a visitorial power, that is, an authority to inspect their actions, and regulate their behavior, as he pleaseth. Indeed, where the poor are not incorporated, according to the case in 10 Co. there is no visitorial power; because the interest of the revenue is not vested in them; but where they are incorporated, there, to prevent all perverting of the charity, there is by law a visitorial power; and it being a creature of the founder&#x2019;s own, it is reason he and his heirs should have that power, unless they please to devolve it elsewhere.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_32">&#x201C;In our old books, deprived by patron and deprived <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>23<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by visitor, are all one. For it is a benefit that naturally springs out of foundation; and it is in his power to transfer it to another.&#x201D; And so in 2 Jur. Eccles. 473. by Twisten. &#x201C;Whenever there is a cure of souls, the church is visitable, either by the bishop if it belongs to him; if to a layman he must make delegates, if to the King my Lord Keeper does it.&#x201D; And he cites 1 Mod. 12. And the author adds, &#x201C;I presume the Judge, in this case, is to be understood as to the man&#x2019;s making delegates, to mean if he finds himself unequal to his duty, then he is bound in conscience to delegate commissioners qualified for it; but not that he may not do it himself, though he be really able; for it is to be observed, if his commissioners do otherwise than he is convinced in his conscience they ought, he may still undertake and determine it himself, according to conscience, and as he may so take it up. I conceive, no reason can be shewn, why he cannot do it in the first instance; for his commissioners are but in aid of him, and I conceive, in this case, his power, though more absolute, may be compared to the Ordinary&#x2019;s authority, who, though ordinarily he judges by his Chancellor, or other official; yet he may sit himself and determine matters within his limited jurisdiction, if he pleases, and have, as is to be presumed, abilities.&#x201D; Moore, 765.

En bank le roy, sur un special verdict suit adjudged que l&#x2019;incumbent dun benefice donative poit resigner a son patron, et que il esteant del foundacon le Patron est auxi de son Visitation et correction, et l&#x2019;ordinary n&#x2019;ada ove luy. 8 Ass. 29. and 32.&#x201D; S. C. Cro. Jac. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>24<span class="bracket">]</span></span> 63. S. P. l Mod. 90. Dean of Ferne&#x2019;s case, Dav. 44. a. 46. b. 47. a. And by Co. Lit. 344. a. &#x201C;A church parochial may be Donative and exempt from all ordinary jurisdiction, and the incumbent may resign to the patron, and not to the Ordinary; neither can the Ordinary Visit, but the Patron by commissioners to be appointed by him.&#x201D; So that this much is certain, that in donative churches the right of visitation is in the Patron. And here we must note that in the case of the King&#x2019;s donatives, he does not visit in person, but may make commissioners for that purpose; and if he does not make them his Chancellor acts <span class="ital">ex officio</span> for him. Thus by F. N. B. 42 a. &#x201C;The King may have a prohibition directed to the Ordinary, that he shall not visit the hospitals, which are of the King&#x2019;s foundation, or of the foundation of his predecessors; because that the Chancellor of England ought to visit them and no other. And so is it of the King&#x2019;s or his progenitors free chapels, no Ordinary shall visit them, but the Chancellor of England.&#x201D; S. P. Dav. 26. b. &#x201C;If the King doth found a church Hospital, or free chapel, donative, he may exempt the same from ordinary jurisdiction, and then his Chancellor shall visit the same. Nay, if the King do found the same without any special exemption, the Ordinary is not, but the King&#x2019;s Chancellor, to visit the same.&#x201D; Co. Lit. 344. a. But &#x201C;the King may, if he pleases, make a special commission.&#x201D; 6. H. 4. 14. Dy. 273. As in the case of Waldron <span class="ital">v.</span> Pollard, Dyer 273, the King gave a commission to visit his donative. So in the case of the college of William and Mary in this country, which is of royal foundation, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>25<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the King did by his charter appoint commissioners for the purpose of visitation, and prescribed the rules for keeping up a perpetual succession of them. So that it appears that the patron of a donative is visitor of right, and where the King is patron, he may appoint commissioners, but if he does not, his Chancellor visits <span class="ital">ex officio</span> for him. And indeed, it is worthy the attention of this court, that if as an ecclesiastical court they should take on them to visit our clergy, and it should appear they are not visitable for any ecclesiastical court, the error is not excused by the law in this as in other cases, where a judge happens to be mistaken in his opinion, but he incurs the penalties of a premunire, which are a forfeiture of property, outlawry, and perpetual imprisonment of the person. These were first introduced by the stat. 16. R. 2. for drawing causes of temporal cognisance (and all cases of advowsons are tryable by the temporal courts only) &#x201C;<span class="ital">in curiam Romanam vel alibi.</span>&#x201D; The word &#x201C;<span class="ital">alibi</span>&#x201D; has been construed to extend to any ecclesiastical court. Thus in 12 Co. 38. &#x201C;For as it was resolved by all the Justices, Pasch. 4 Jac. reg. <span class="ital">est contra coronam et dignitatem regiam,</span> when any ecclesiastical Judge doth usurp upon the temporal law, because, as in all those writs it appeareth, the interest or cause of the subject is drawn <span class="ital">ad aliud examen,</span> that is, when the subject ought to have his cause ended by the common law, where unto by birthright he is inheritable, he is drawn in <span class="ital">aliud examen</span> (viz) to be decided and determined by the ecclesiastical law; and this is truly said <span class="ital">contra coronam et dignitatem regiam.</span> And this appears by <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>26<span class="bracket">]</span></span> all the prohibitions (which are infinite) which have been directed to the high commissioners and others, after the said act. By 1 Eliz. <span class="ital">a fortiori,</span> he who offends in a premunire shall be said to offend <span class="ital">contra coronam et dignitatem regiam.</span> And this in effect answers to all the aforesaid objections; but yet other particular answers shall be given to every of them.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_33">As to the third, although the court by force of high commission is the court of the King, yet their proceedings are ecclesiastical: and for this, if they usurp upon the temporal law, this is the same offence which was before the said act of 10 Eliz. For this was the end of all the antient acts, that the temporal law shall not in any manner be emblemished by any ecclesiastical proceedings.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_34">As to the fourth, although it be a new court, yet the antient statutes extend to it within this word <span class="ital">alibi,</span> and divers new Bishopricks were erected in the time of Henry VIII., and yet there was never any question but that the antient acts of premunire, extended to them.&#x201D; And in Bro. Abr. I find it expressly determined to be a premunire to call the incumbent of a donative before an ecclesiastical visitation. &#x201C;Per aliquos benefice donative per le patron tantum est lay chose et levesque ne visitera, et ideo ned deprivera, et donque sil mella in ce il est in le case de premunire, et in ce case suit Barloo evesque de Bathe tempore. E. 6. Et suit arct de obteiner un pardon, eo que il avoit deprive le deane de Welles que suit un donative per letters patents le ray per acte de parlament ent sait, tamen 8. E. 3. supra ne adjudge. (8 Ass. p 29.&#x201D;) Bro. Abr. Premunire 21. So that my conclusions <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>27<span class="bracket">]</span></span> from the premises, so far as necessary in the present question are, That donative churches, being originally founded by a lay-patron, and being still subject to his donation, are likewise subject to his sole visitation, the ecclesiastical judge having no right to intermeddle: and again, That if the patron be a subject, he may visit either in person or by commissioners; if he be the King, he may also appoint commissioners, but if he make no appointment, the Chancellor visits <span class="ital">ex officio.</span></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_35">Our last enquiry is, To what class belong the churches of our government? are they collatives? are they presentatives? or are they donatives? Collatives they are not: because these were described as having existed immemorially, and been all that time disposed of by the bishop, which immemorial usage had confirmed the right in law. But our parishes pretend to no immemorial existence, for that would make them older than our government itself: they have been erected by acts of Assembly long within memory, to be found by any one who will recur to our records. Nor was there ever an instance of collation to one of them by a bishop. &#x201C;If an act of Parliament make a particular district a particular separate distinct parish, the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical court does not attach upon it, for this clear reason, that it was not such immemorially. Parish St. John, Clerkenwell, 9 Geo. 2. B. R.&#x201D; 2 Jur. Eccl. 348. Neither are our churches of the presentative kind because of these the distinguishing characteristic is, that, though of lay foundation, yet the bishop has acquired a right of having the clerk presented for his <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>28<span class="bracket">]</span></span> examination, admission or refusal. But no such right was ever pretended in our churches, nor was there ever an instance in them of presentation to a bishop. But they are of the donative kind. These were said, 1st. to have been founded by laymen; 2nd. not to be subject to presentation to a bishop; 3rd. to lie purely in the gift of the patron. Now let us see if these characters are not applicable to our churches. The act of Assembly, 1661, c. 1. directs that a church shall be built in every parish, and c. 2. that the expenses of building and keeping it in repair, provision for the poor, and maintenance of the minister, be levied on the people of the parish; c. 3. that there be a glebe laid out in every parish, and a convenient house built for the abode of the minister; and that a maintenance be provided for him, which shall be worth eighty pounds per annum, besides his perquisites and glebe. The act of 1696, c. 11. instead of the &#xA3;80 given the minister by that of 1661, c. 3. gives him sixteen thousand pounds of tobacco, besides his perquisites, to be levied &#x201C;by the vestries in their respective parishes&#x201D;; and lastly the act of 1748, c. 34. (<span class="ital">old ed&#x2019;ns</span>) sect. 1. confirms this salary to them, to be levied by the vestry &#x201C;upon the titheable persons in their respective parishes&#x201D;; and sect. 5. directs that the glebe shall contain two hundred acres of good land at the least, and that there shall be built on it a convenient mansion house, kitchen, barn, stable, dairy, meat house, cornhouse, and garden, the expenses of which are to be levied on the titheable persons in the parishes. Here it might be thought prima facie perhaps, that as the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>29<span class="bracket">]</span></span> parishioners pay the money they are the founders and endowers. But a little attention will, I think, discover this to be a fallacy. The parishioners are indeed the persons ordered to furnish the money; but the erection of the parishes and gift of the salary, or in other words, the foundation and endowment of the church, is the act of the legislature. They direct an officer to levy sixteen thousand pounds of tobacco on the titheable persons of the parish. As soon as it is in his hands it is the money of the public, and then they order him to pay it to the minister of the parish, just as if the founder of a church should endow it with an annuity which, by his charter of donation, should be payable out of his manor of Blackacre; his tenants of that manor, though they furnished the money, would hardly be considered as the founders and endowers. Suppose the legislature, instead of directing the payment of these expenses to be levied on the particular parishioners, had ordered the payment out of the public purse; the foundation and endowment would surely then have been their acts: but what difference can it produce, if instead of ordering the parish collector to pay the money to the treasurer, and him again to the minister, they adopt the shorter method of making the collector pay it immediately to the minister. Our own country furnishes a decisive refutation of this notion. The college of William and Mary is endowed with duties on skins, furs, liquors, tobaccos, paid by the exporters and importers, though given by the legislature. Yet was it never supposed, that that college was founded or endowed by the exporters or <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>30<span class="bracket">]</span></span> importers of these commodities. As little then can the parishioners, though the parochial taxes be assessed on them, be called the founders and endowers of our churches. The truth is, the parish is erected, the church and its soil given, and also the endowment, by the legislature, or in other words by the community whom they represent. Now that is a civil, not an ecclesiastical body. The churches are therefore of lay foundation. Again, if we consider the community, as made up of King and People, the King will then be the patron of our churches, it being a known branch of the royal prerogative, that where the King and his subjects are joint founders, the rights of patronage vest in the King. 1 Bl.481. Or if we consider it in a constitutional point of view, the same consequence will be evolved. For wherever an act of Parliament or of Assembly erects a new office, without prescribing the particular mode of appointing the officer, it belongs to the King to make the appointment. And for this reason; that possessing the executive power of the laws, it is his peculiar duty to see each act carried into execution, which cannot be unless an officer is appointed. 1 Bl. 272. On this principle, is almost every officer in Great Britain, as well as in Virginia, appointed by the crown; the acts erecting the offices, never prescribing the mode of appointment unless where they mean to give it from the crown. If then our acts of Assembly, erecting cures of souls, and declaring that they shall be given to ecclesiastics of a certain sect, have not said by whom the nomination shall be, it will follow that the King, who is to see the law executed, must nominate persons <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>31<span class="bracket">]</span></span> for that purpose. We have but two acts relative to this matter. The act of 1661, c. 4. says that a minister, producing to the Governor letters of ordination from some bishop in England, and subscribing, &amp;c. the Governor is to induct them into &#x201C;any parish that shall make presentation of him.&#x201D; This law, without doubt, gave the nomination to the parishioners collectively, though it preserved to the crown the right of donation or actual investiture. But the impropriety and inconvenience of popular elections of priests, and the unfitness of the people to judge of their qualifications, had soon caused the vestries to usurp this right, and even their unreadiness to choose where the choice was to be followed by immediate assessments for maintenance, together with the doubt at what time the King might interpose to supply the vacancy, induced the necessity of altering the constitution of the churches in this respect. In 1748, therefore, the right of nomination was restored to the crown, except for the first twelve months after an avoidance, during which it was given to the vestrymen of the parish. Act 1748, c. 34. (<span class="ital">old ed&#x2019;ns.</span>) s. 7. &#x201C;And whereas it is doubted how long the right of presentation of a minister to a parish, remains in the vestries in this colony: for settling that matter be it enacted, that the sole right of presentation shall be, and remain, in the several vestries, for and during the term of twelve months next after a vacancy shall happen in their respective parishes.&#x201D; But perhaps it may be thought that the right of choosing, given by this act to the vestries in the first instance, is another mark of foundership; and if they are founders, of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>32<span class="bracket">]</span></span> course they are visitors. This must be answered by distinguishing between the act of nomination, which is given them for a twelve month, and of donation or induction, which is reserved to the crown, and is better expressed by the word investiture. Nomination is defined by Cowell to be &#x201C;a power to appoint a clerk to a patron of a benefice.&#x201D; And he says the word &#x201C;invest, signifies to give <span class="ital">possession.</span> Others,&#x201D; says he, &#x201C;define it thus, <span class="ital">investiture est in suum jus alicujus introductio,</span> a giving livery of seisin or possession.&#x201D; This, in donative churches, is effected by the single deed of donation, without other ceremony. &#x201C;Donatives are given and fully possessed by the single donation of the patron in writing, without presentation, institution, or induction.&#x201D; Gibs. 819. 1 Burn. Eccl. L. 154. And in collatives and presentatives it is effected by induction. &#x201C;Induction is, by the canon law, called corporal possession, and is compared in the books of common law to livery and seisin, by which possession is given to temporal estates.&#x201D; Gibs. 814. Burn. Eccl. L. 157. So that the right given the vestry is barely to name for one twelve month, whereas the crown, is on that nomination, to make the deed of donation, or give corporal possession. The act indeed for nomination, uses the presentation; the sense of which, as used in the ecclesiastical law, is to present to a bishop, and is in its nature and effect very different from nomination and for donation, it uses the word induction, which has indeed the same meaning of delivering actual possession, only that it is usually applied to the delivery of a different kind of church. However our legislators <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>33<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of 1661, were not critics in the language of the law; and it matters not, since they have plainly enough signified what they meant. These rights of nomination and investiture are generally indeed in the same person, and are both exercised by one and the same act. Thus when in a donative, a patron makes a deed of donation, it is a nomination as well as an investiture. But they may be separated; as happens when the patron grants away the next avoidance. There the grantee has only the right of nominating; but the grantor or patron is to invest. For says Gibs. 794, &#x201C;the right of nomination may be in one person, and the right of presentation in another. And this is where he who was seized of the advowson doth grant unto another and his heirs, that as often as the church becomes void, the grantee and his heirs shall nominate to the grantor and his heirs; who shall be bound to present accordingly. In such case it was agreed by the whole court in the case of Shirley and Underhill, Mod. 894, that the nomination is the substance of the advowson, and the presentation no more than a ministerial interest.&#x201D; 1 Burn. Eccl. L. 122. Now this is precisely the case between our vestries and the crown under the act of Assembly. The King being considered as the founder and patron of the church, if nothing had been said, would have possessed both rights of nomination and vestiture. But the acts give the vestries, for one twelve month, the right of nominating to the Governor, the person whom he is to induct or invest with possession. It is similar to the case of sheriffs and inspectors, who are nominated by the court, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>34<span class="bracket">]</span></span> but commissioned or invested with their office by the Governor. So in the case of a clerk, it is not the nomination by the vestry, but the Governor&#x2019;s investiture which puts him into possession, and entitles him to the temporalities of his cure. So that while the act takes from the King, <span class="ital">pro tempore,</span> and transfers to the vestry, the right of nomination, which was one of the rights incident to his patronage, it leaves him the ensigns of that right, to wit, investiture. And still the estate in law which was in the King, is made to pass from him by his act of investiture, and not from the vestry by their nomination. So that like the case before cited of the grant of a next avoidance, though the nomination be in the grantee, yet the presentation to the bishop, if it be presentative, or the deed of donation, if it be donative, must be by the patron. He still continues the patron, and he, not the grantee, possesses the right of visitation. Thus then it may be stated in fewer words. The King is the patron of all our churches. The rights of patrons are 1st. Nomination. 2nd. Investiture. 3rd. Visitation. Only one of these rights, viz. nomination, was taken away, and that but for a limited time. The other two, of vestiture and visitation, were not touched, and consequently still remain in him.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_36">We may safely, therefore conclude that our churches are donatives, because they wear the three characteristics of donatives. 1. They are of lay foundation. 2. They are not subject to presentation to a bishop. 3. They lie in the gift of the patron. That patron is the King, and though one <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>35<span class="bracket">]</span></span> right of patronage, viz. nomination, is taken away <span class="ital">pro tempore,</span> yet the others, of vestiture and visitation, still remain in him. The latter is the power now called into exercise; and his majesty having never been pleased to appoint commissioners for that purpose, it is to be exercised by his Chancellor here; that is by the members of this honorable court who possess the powers of a Chancellor: not indeed sitting on this bench of chancery, but as a court of visitation at any other time or place, at which you shall think proper to call the incumbent before you.</p>

<div class="salute csc">Dear Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_38">&#x2014;Encouraged by the small acquaintance which I had the pleasure of having contracted with you during your residence in this country, I take the liberty of making the present application to you. I understood you were related to the gentleman of your name (Mr. James McPherson), to whom the world is so much indebted for the elegant collection, arrangement, and translation of Ossian&#x2019;s poems. These pieces have been and will, I think, during my life, continue to be to me the sources of daily pleasures. The tender and the sublime emotions of the mind were never before so wrought up by the human hand. I am not ashamed to own that I think this rude bard of the north the greatest poet that has ever existed. Merely for the pleasure of reading his works I am become desirous of learning the language in which he sung, and of possessing his songs in their original form. Mr. McPherson, I think, informs us he is possessed of the originals. Indeed, a gentleman has lately told me he had seen them in print; but I am afraid he has mistaken a specimen from <span class="ital">Temora,</span> annexed to some of the editions of the translation, for the whole works. If they are printed, it will abridge my request and your trouble, to the sending me a printed copy; but if there be more such my petition is, that you would be so good as to use your interest with Mr. McPherson to obtain leave to take a manuscript copy of them, and procure it to be done. I would choose it in a fair, round hand, on <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>37<span class="bracket">]</span></span> fine paper, with a good margin, bound in parchments as elegantly as possible, lettered on the back, and marbled or gilt on the edges of the leaves. I would not regard expense in doing this. I would further beg the favor of you to give me a catalogue of the books written in that language, and to send me such of them as may be necessary for learning it. These will, of course, include a grammar and dictionary. The cost of these, as well as the copy of Ossian, will be (for me), on demand, answered by Mr. Alexander McCaul, sometime of Virginia, merchant, but now of Glasgow, or by your friend Mr. Ninian Minzees, of Richmond, in Virginia, to whose care the books may be sent. You can, perhaps, tell me whether we may ever hope to see any more of those Celtic pieces published. Manuscript copies of any which are in print, it would at any time give me the greatest happiness to receive. The glow of one warm thought is to me worth more than money. I hear with pleasure from your friend that your path through life is likely to be smoothed by success. I wish the business and the pleasures of your situation would admit leisure now and then to scribble a line to one who wishes you every felicity, and would willingly merit the appellation of, dear sir, Your friend and humble servant.</p>

I once mentioned to you the court of Albemarle as worthy your attention. If you chuse now to go there I would get you to take his papers for that court also. They put you in possession of a valuable business. The king&#x2019;s attorney&#x2019;s place is vacant there, and might be worth your solliciting. If you think so you should dispatch an express for commission. Otherwise you may be prevented. Write me a line in answer to this and lodge it here within a week, as I shall about that time call here to take the law papers and put them into some channel. Your assistance in these matters will oblige, Dear Fleming your friend and humble serv&#x2019;t.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_41">On serious Consideration of the present state of our practice in the General Court we find it can no longer <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>39<span class="bracket">]</span></span> be continued on the same Terms. The Fees allowed by Law, if regularly paid, would barely compensate our incessant Labours, reimburse our expences and the losses incurred by Neglect of our private Affairs; yet even these Rewards, confessedly moderate, are withheld from us, in a great Proportion, by the unworthy Part of our Clients. Some regulation, therefore, is become absolutely requisite to establish Terms more equal between the Client and his Council. To effect this, we have come to the following Resolution, for the invariable Observance of which we mutually plight our Honour to each other: &#x201C;That after the 10th day of <span class="ital">October</span> next we will not give an Opinion on any Case stated to us but on Payment of the whole Fee, nor prosecute or defend any Suit or Motion unless the Tax, and one half of the Fee, be previously advanced, excepting those Cases only where we choose to act <span class="ital">gratis;</span>&#x201D; and we hope no person whatever may think of applying to us in any other Way. To prevent Disappointment, however, in Case this should be done, we think it proper to give this Warning, that no such Application, either verbal or by Way of Letter, will be answered to in the smallest Degree. We would feel much Concern if a Thought could be entertained that the worthy Part of our Clients could disapprove of this Measure. Their Conduct has been such as calls for our Acknowledgements and might merit exemption from this Strictness, were such Exemption practicable, but they will readily perceive this would defeat the Purpose, and that no distinction of Persons can by any means be attempted. We hope, therefore, from <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>40<span class="bracket">]</span></span> their Friendship, a cheerful concurrence in this Plan, since the Requisition is such only as their Punctuallity would of itself prevent.</p>

<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>43<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_54"><span class="ital">Resolved,</span> That the inhabitants of the Several States of <span class="ital">British America</span> are subject to the laws which they adopted at their first settlement, and to such others as have been since made by their respective Legislatures, duly constituted and appointed with their own consent. That no other Legislature whatever can rightly exercise authority over them; and that these privileges they hold as the common rights of mankind, confirmed by the political constitutions they have respectively assumed, and also by several charters of compact from the Crown.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_55"><span class="ital">Resolved,</span> That these their natural and legal rights have in frequent instances been invaded by the Parliament of <span class="ital">Great Britain</span> and particularly that they were so by an act lately passed to take away the trade of the inhabitants of the town of <span class="ital">Boston,</span> in the province of <span class="ital">Massachusetts Bay;</span> that all such assumptions of unlawful power are dangerous to the right of the <span class="ital">British</span> empire in general, and should be considered as its common cause, and that we will ever be ready to join with our fellow-subjects in every part of the same, in executing all those rightful powers which God has given us, for the re-establishment and guaranteeing such their constitutional rights, when, where, and by whomsoever invaded.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_56">It is the opinion of this meeting, that the most eligible means of affecting these purposes, will be to put an immediate stop to all imports from <span class="ital">Great Britain,</span> (cotton, osnabrigs, striped duffil, medicines, gunpowder, lead, books and printed papers, the necessary tolls and implements for the handicraft arts and manufactures excepted, for a limited term) and to all <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>44<span class="bracket">]</span></span> exports thereto, after the first day of <span class="ital">October,</span> which shall be in the year of our Lord, 1775; and immediately to discontinue all commercial intercourse with every part of the <span class="ital">British</span> Empire which shall not in like manner break off their commerce with <span class="ital">Great Britain.</span></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_57">It is the opinion of this meeting, that we immediately cease to import all commodities from every part of the world, which are subjected by the <span class="ital">British</span> Parliament to the payment of duties in <span class="ital">America.</span></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_58">It is the opinion of this meeting, that these measures should be pursued until a repeal be obtained of the Act for blocking up the harbour of <span class="ital">Boston;</span> of the Acts prohibiting or restraining internal manufactures in <span class="ital">America;</span> of the Acts imposing on any commodities duties to be paid in <span class="ital">America;</span> and of the Act laying restrictions on the <span class="ital">American</span> trade; and that on such repeal it will be reasonable to grant to our brethren of <span class="ital">Great Britain</span> such privileges in commerce as may amply compensate their fraternal assistance, past and future.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_59"><span class="ital">Resolved,</span> However, that this meeting do submit these their opinions to the Convention of Deputies from the several counties of this Colony, and appointed to be held at <span class="ital">Williamsburg</span> on the first day of <span class="ital">August</span> next, and also to the General Congress of Deputies from the several <span class="ital">American</span> States, when and wheresoever held; and that they will concur in these or any other measures which such convention or such Congress shall adopt as most expedient for the <span class="ital">American</span> good; and we do appoint <span class="ital">Thomas Jefferson</span> and <span class="ital">John Walker</span> our Deputies to act for this county <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>45<span class="bracket">]</span></span> at the said Convention, and instruct them to conform themselves to these our Resolutions and Opinions.</p>

<h2 id="lf0054-02_head_022">A SUMMARY VIEW
<span class="subhead">1774</span></h2>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_70">One of the most difficult points to be met by the proposed Congress of the Colonies was an agreement of a common ground on which to rest their statements of grievances and claims for redress. While all the colonies were united in resisting and protesting, they nevertheless, like the individuals in each colony, disagreed on foundations and degrees. The various arguments of James Otis, Stephen Hopkins, John Dickinson, Daniel Dulaney, and Richard Bland had each its own supporters and followers, and were all almost equally untenable. Virginia being so prominent in the movement for the Congress, as well as in colony influence generally, her instructions to her attending delegates would carry great if not controlling influence in that body, and might supply the field for all future contests. Under this belief, Jefferson desired that the strongest position should be taken from the start, and so prepared this paper as the instructions for the delegates from Virginia to the first Congress. Of it, he himself wrote:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_71">&#x201C;Before I left home to attend the Convention, I prepared what I thought might be given, in instruction, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>50<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to the Delegates who should be appointed to attend the General Congress proposed. They were drawn in haste, with a number of blanks, with some uncertainties and inaccuracies of historical facts, which I neglected at the moment, knowing they could be readily corrected at the meeting. I set out on my journey, but was taken sick on the road, and was unable to proceed. I therefore sent on, by express, two copies, one under cover to Patrick Henry, the other to Peyton Randolph, who I knew would be in the chair of the Convention. Of the former, no more was ever heard or known. Mr. Henry probably thought it too bold, as a first measure, as the majority of the members did. On the other copy being laid on the table of the Convention, by Peyton Randolph, as the proposition of a member, who was prevented from attendance by sickness on the road, tamer sentiments were preferred, and, I believe, wisely preferred; the leap I proposed being too long, as yet, for the mass of our citizens. The distance between these, and the instructions actually adopted is of some curiosity, however, as it shews the inequality of pace with which we moved, and the prudence required to keep front and rear together. My creed had been formed on unsheathing the sword at Lexington. They printed the paper, however, and gave it the title of &#x2018;A summary view of the rights of British America.&#x2019; In this form it got to London, where the opposition took it up, shaped it to opposition views, and, in that form, it ran rapidly through several editions.&#x201D;</p>

<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>51<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_73">Edmund Randolph gives a further and somewhat different account of it as follows:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_74">&#x201C;Thomas Jefferson, who was one of the elected, was prevented by indisposition from attending. But he forwarded by express for the consideration of its members a series of resolutions. I distinctly recollect the applause bestowed on the most of them, when they were read to a large company at the house of Peyton Randolph, to whom they were addressed. Of all the approbation was not equal. From the celebrated letters of the Pennsylvanian Farmer (John Dickinson) we had been instructed to bow to the external taxation of parliament, as resulting from our migration, and a necessary dependence on the mother country. But this composition of Mr. Jefferson, shook this conceeded principle although it had been confirmed by a still more celebrated pamphlet of Daniel Dulaney of Maryland, and cited by Lord Chatham as a text book of American rights. The young ascended with Mr. Jefferson to the source of those rights, the old required time for consideration before they could tread this lofty ground, which, if it had not been abandoned, at least had not been fully occupied throughout America. From what cause it happened, that the resolutions were not printed by order of the convention does not appear; but as they were not adopted, several of the author&#x2019;s admirers subscribed for their publication. When the time of writing is remembered, a range of inquiry not then very frequent, and marching far beyond the politics of the day will surely be allowed them.&#x201D;&#x2014;<span class="ital">Ms. History of Virginia,</span> p. 25.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>52<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_75">These resolutions were printed in a twenty-three-paged pamphlet at Williamsburg, from a copy of which edition, formerly in Jefferson&#x2019;s possession, and now in the Library of Congress, containing his MS. notes and corrections, it is here reprinted. The numerals inserted in the text indicate the pagings of this edition.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_76">Of this copy Jefferson wrote to Merriwether Jones, Oct. 19, 1804:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_77">&#x201C;I received last night your favor of the 15th. I have but a single copy of the pamphlet you ask for and that is bound up in a volume of pamphlets of the same year and making one of a long suite of volumes of the same nature. I mention this to impress you with the value I set on the volume as part of the history of the times, and to justify a request of attention in the use and return of it. It happens that Mr. Duval sets out this afternoon for Richmond &amp; furnishes an opportunity of conveying it to you. It should be noted in the republication that the title, the motto and the preface were of the editors, and, with the piece itself, were printed without my knolege. I had drawn the paper at home, set out for the Convention, was taken ill on the road &amp; sent on the paper to Peyton Randolph, moderator of the Convention. It was laid by him on the table of the convention for the perusal of the members, and by them justly deemed ahead of the sentiments of the times: but some of them deemed it useful to publish it &amp; they affixed the title, epigraph and preface. I was informed by Parson Hurt who was in England when it arrived there that it ran through several editions there.&#x201D;</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>53<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_78">It was reprinted in Philadelphia, without any change of text, with the following title:</p>

[8vo. pp. 23.]</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_80">Jefferson states that it was &#x201C;taken up by the opposition&#x201D; in England, &#x201C;interpolated a little by Mr. Burke so as to make it answer opposition purposes, and in that form ran rapidly through several editions.&#x201D; Two editions were printed in England with the following titles:</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_83">The texts of these two editions are not, however, in the slightest degree altered or added to, except by a new preface. Of it the <span class="ital">Monthly Review</span> said:</p>

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_87">&#x201C;There is not a man of thought, in the whole nation, who does not espouse bad measures from bad principles, but is justly alarmed, and seriously anxious, for the common good. Affairs of such magnitude now employ the public attention, as seem to involve in them the fate of EMPIRE. The times are big with great events. What will be the consequences, it is not in human sagacity to foretel. But if the same system be pursued, which for a long time hath employed the attention of your Majesty&#x2019;s ministers, they ought to tremble for their heads.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_88">&#x201C;The present contentions with America, if not soon happily terminated, must end in such scenes of trouble, bloodshed, and devastation, which, in contemplation <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>55<span class="bracket">]</span></span> alone, shock us with horror. But little time remains for deliberation or choice: a blow will lead on to the decisive scene; and the tyranny begun. This era of your Majesty&#x2019;s reign is likely to be marked with the most important characters. It is impossible for subjects to stand by idle, unaffected spectators, when they see their Sovereign, and themselves, nearly involved in distresses, which, for ought he can foresee, may end in the ruin of both: you, Sir! may lose your sovereignty and honour; we, our liberties, fortunes, and lives.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_89">&#x201C;The charge of presumption upon individuals, for speaking freely upon these important things, is at once taken off, by the evidence of things themselves, and the transcendant interest that every man has in them. Of affairs of state; of the artifice, cunning, address, and subtility of courts, it is the general lot to be ignorant: But of the great principles of government, especially of this free state, of those laws, and proceedings, that are either subversive, or corroborative of the system, many are as able to judge as any minister employed in your Majesty&#x2019;s service. These, with the first laws of nature, the prerogatives of man in human society, with the sacred and immutable laws of justice, equity, moderation, and wisdom, men fully understand, who were never tutored or well received at court; where indeed, for the most part, men are more likely to lose than gain, accurate ideas of these things. They are not among the arcana imperii: we can judge of them; and have a fair, undoubted, constitutional right, as free subjects, who claim liberty by birth-right, and enjoy it by the laws, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>56<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to apply these principles to the present conduct of your Majesty&#x2019;s ministers. And, in justice bound to our country, and ourselves, and that fidelity we owe, Sir, to you, as our Sovereign, we openly declare, that the whole proceedings against our brethren in America, who are entitled, in common with ourselves, to the privileges of men, and the liberties, franchises, and protection of Englishmen, are in open violation of the natural laws of equity and justice: and unparalleled infractions upon the principles, and promulgated laws of this free state: not to say, that every idea of good policy is sacrificed to maintain and inforce the most vicious and dangerous system that ever infatuated despots pursued.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_90">&#x201C;Fruitless were the hopes that these few pages will effect, what the sagest counsels, the most consummate wisdom and plainest remonstrances, of some of the wisest, and best men, of the present age, have not been able to accomplish. But if the perusal, either by your Majesty, or your ministers, should for a moment, suspend the fatal counsels, or designs which are now taking, or seem systematically planned to overturn AMERICAN LIBERTY, I shall think my labours well rewarded. God is my witness, that I write not these things to excite sedition, or stir up rebellion: I should deem my life well disposed of, if, by the sacrifice, your Majesty could learn the wisdom of righteous government, and your ministers be taught to counsel good things. Happy should I be to convince your Majesty, where legal authority ends, and tyranny begins; and that your dignity alone consists in the happiness of your subjects; and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>57<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that when virtue and justice forsake your councils, error and ruin must inevitably ensue. With your Majesty&#x2019;s ministers we can keep no longer. If at any time we pitied their innocent infirmities, that pity has long ago been converted into abhorrence from the wickedness of their counsels, and the injustice of their deeds. By their breaches upon your prerogative, Sir! they have broken down the legal barriers of the constitution, and destroyed the distinctions of government; they have changed, or attempted to change lawful possession into arbitrary dominion: and, in the mad career, they may endeavor to make their Sovereign dispense with every thing that entitles him to obedience; and, by this means, convert the first duty of subjects into an opposition which the great and primary law of nature, self-defence, makes necessary. Those cruel, in-expedient tyrannical measures, which first they adopted, respecting America, notwithstanding the perilous circumstances into which they have brought both the colonies, and our own country, they carry violently on; as if they could persuade us that perseverance was integrity; and open opposition, state necessity. Their system is not only manifestly repugnant to the laws of the state; but it runs counter to the whole stream of authority, and examples derived from the various histories of the several states of the world. From them, they ought to have learned that confidence is the first, and strongest principle of obedience; and, which once lost, is seldom recovered; and that almost all struggles for liberty, against violence, and oppression, have been crowned with success; <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>58<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and, without impiety, whatever doctrines concerning Providence may prevail at court, we attribute such success to the interposition of Heaven: and to Heaven the Americans now appeal. And, would to God that any accommodations could soften those rigours which your Majesty&#x2019;s ministers seemed determined to pursue. But it seems that no equivalent but Liberty will be deemed a sufficient satisfaction for the affronts which the honest struggles for freedom have given: under the pretence of law, natural justice and equity fall defeated; and the constitution is wounded under the semblance of a temporary cure.&#x2014;Your ministers, Sir! are total strangers to those nice temperaments and allays to mitigate the evils and maladies of the state, in which much of the wisdom of government consists. They strain, where they ought to relax; and think to accomplish by exertion, what they want abilities to effect by lenient measures. They do not see these happy mediums, so necessary in the adjustments of great affairs; by which authority is preserved on the one hand, and allegiance secured on the other. These impracticable men renounce all expedients but power. They have recourse to arms, when they should seek only counsel. They attempt that by oppression which justice, well administered, would more effectually accomplish.&#x2014;They talk of enforcing the laws, when they are violating the constitution; and urge the necessities of state, when they themselves are the authors of the very necessities of which they complain. They are for doing that in a free state, which the most despotic, in like circumstances, if wise, would carefully <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>59<span class="bracket">]</span></span> avoid. What is there, Sir! to countenance so great a hazard of ruining America, and distressing ourselves? of exciting them to arms, and ourselves to the slaughter of our own sons? Have your ministers, Sir! discovered mines of inexhaustible riches in America, which they wish to plunder, to discharge our enormous national debt? Alas! they will find no other riches but what a strenuous industry has gained; virtue, which the love of Liberty has inspired; and a race of men not degenerate enough to part with Freedom without a noble struggle. Before their charters were violated, their laws infringed, their trade oppressed, one of their chief cities, and its inhabitants sent to awe and intimidate them, their lives and fortunes were at our disposal: can subjects offer, can they give more? I will be bold to declare to your Majesty, that before these fatal proceedings, no nation in the known history of the world, considering the growing strength, grandeur, and extent of that mighty empire, tho&#x2019; dependent, could ever boast such confidence and obedience, as Great Britain did in her Colonies. These are now in danger of being irrecoverably lost, not by their defection, but our own unaccountable folly. <span class="ital">Quos Deus vult perdere, eos prius dementat.</span></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_91">&#x201C;Your ministers, Sir! as tyrants ever do, justify their oppressions, by the resistance they have met with: and perhaps have imposed upon their Prince, by talking of the satisfaction which the honour and dignity of the crown should receive upon their supposed violation. Satisfy, Sir! the dignity and honour of the crown; but let your ministers beware that <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>60<span class="bracket">]</span></span> they do not sacrifice your crown to the vain, and impracticable schemes of satisfying its honour, and maintaining its dignity. I will boldly affirm, Sir, that if the dignity and honour of the crown are to be purchased at the rate your ministers seem to estimate them, that the price will be held too dear by every good, and virtuous man in the nation.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_92">&#x201C;And here, Sir! pause&#x2014;disappoint your ministers, and gratify millions of your subjects. The Americans have not as yet revolted. They have not thrown off their allegiance. Their submission is so habitual, that it cannot easily be dispensed with. Do them but justice, and they will esteem it an act of Grace. They will call that a favour now, which hereafter they will claim as their right. What they now demand, the following pages, which, with all due submission, I offer to your Majesty, will declare&#x2014;hitherto they have kept themselves within proper limits; and have extended their requests no farther than they were countenanced by the laws, and that friendly protection, which from our country, they had reason to expect. But further oppressions, Sir, may probably change their mode of suit. Allegiance will sometimes relax its submission. Wisdom itself does not intermeddle in the regulation of extremities; and what can moderate the conduct of despair? When dangers surround men they are not very nice in the method of salvation. And the only means of extricating themselves, will appear the right. When our friends rise up to oppress us, it is pardonable, and justifiable, to throw ourselves into the arms, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>61<span class="bracket">]</span></span> even of an enemy, for protection. I am, with all due submission, and allegiance, your Majesty&#x2019;s faithful subject,</p>

<h2 id="lf0054-02_head_024">A SUMMARY VIEW, ETC.</h2>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_93">Resolved, that it be an instruction to the said deputies, when assembled in general congress with the deputies from the other states of British America, to propose to the said congress that an humble and dutiful address be presented to his Majesty, begging leave to lay before him, as Chief Magistrate of the British empire, the united complaints of his Majesty&#x2019;s subjects in America; complaints which are excited by many unwarrantable encroachments and usurpations, attempted to be made by the Legislature of one part of the empire, upon those rights which God and the laws have given equally and independently to all. To represent to his Majesty that these his states have often individually made humble application to his imperial throne to obtain, through its intervention, some redress of their injured rights, to none of which was ever even an answer condescended; humbly to hope that this their joint address, penned in the language of truth, and divested of those expressions of servility which would persuade his Majesty that we were asking favours, and not rights, shall obtain from his Majesty a more respectful acceptance. And this his Majesty will think we have reason to expect when he reflects that he is no more <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>64<span class="bracket">]</span></span> than the chief officer of the people, appointed by the laws, and circumscribed with definite powers, to assist in working the great machine of government, erected for their use, and consequently subject [6] to their superintendance. And in order that these our rights, as well as the invasions of them, may be laid more fully before his Majesty, to take a view of them from the origin and first settlement of these countries.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_94">To remind him that our ancestors, before their emigration to America, were the free inhabitants of the British dominions in Europe, and possessed a right which nature has given to all men, of departing from the country in which chance, not choice, has placed them, of going in quest of new habitations, and of there establishing new societies, under such laws and regulations as to them shall seem most likely to promote public happiness. That their Saxon ancestors had, under this universal law, in like manner left their native wilds and woods in the north of Europe, had possessed themselves of the island of Britain, then less charged with inhabitants, and had established there that system of laws which has so long been the glory and protection of that country. Nor was ever any claim of superiority or dependence asserted over them by that mother country from which they had migrated; and were such a claim made, it is believed that his Majesty&#x2019;s subjects in Great Britain have too firm a feeling of the rights derived to them from their ancestors, to bow down the sovereignty of their state before such visionary pretensions. And it is thought that no circumstance has occurred to distinguish materially the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>65<span class="bracket">]</span></span> British from the Saxon emigration. America was conquered, and her settlement made, and firmly established, at the expense of individuals, and not of the British public. Their own blood was spilt in acquiring lands for their settlements, their own fortunes expended in making that settlement effectual; for themselves they fought, for themselves they conquered, and for themselves alone they have right to hold. Not a shilling<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_019" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_019_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> was ever issued from the public treasures of his Majesty, or his ancestors, for their assistance, till, of very late times, after the colonies had become established on a firm and permanent footing. That then, indeed, having become valuable to Great Britain for her commercial purposes, his Parliament [7] was pleased to lend them assistance against the enemy, who would fain have drawn to herself the benefits of their commerce, to the great aggrandizement of herself, and danger of Great Britain. Such assistance, and in such circumstances, they had often before given to Portugal, and<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_020" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_020_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> other allied states, with whom they carry on a commercial intercourse; yet these states never supposed, that by calling in her aid, they thereby submitted themselves to her sovereignty. Had such terms been proposed, they would have rejected them with disdain, and trusted for better to the moderation of their enemies, or to a vigorous exertion of their own force. We do not, however, mean to under-rate those aids, which to us were doubtless valuable, on whatever principles granted; but we would shew that they <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>66<span class="bracket">]</span></span> cannot give a title to that authority which the British Parliament would arrogate over us, and that they may amply be repaid by our giving to the inhabitants of Great Britain such exclusive privileges in trade as may be advantageous to them, and at the same time not too restrictive to ourselves. That settlements having been thus effected in the wilds of America, the emigrants thought proper to adopt that system of laws under which they had hitherto lived in the mother country, and to continue their union with her by submitting themselves to the same common Sovereign, who was thereby made the central link connecting the several parts of the empire thus newly multiplied.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_95">But that not long were they permitted, however far they thought themselves removed from the hand of oppression, to hold undisturbed the rights thus acquired, at the hazard of their lives, and loss of their fortunes. A family of princes was then on the British throne, whose treasonable crimes against their people brought on them afterwards the exertion of those sacred and sovereign rights of punishment reserved in the hands of the people for cases of extreme necessity, and judged by the constitution unsafe to be delegated to any other judicature. While every day brought forth some new and unjustifiable exertion of power over their subjects on that side the water, it was not [8] to be expected that those here, much less able at that time to oppose the designs of despotism, should be exempted from injury.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_96">Accordingly that country, which had been acquired <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>67<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by the lives, the labours, and the fortunes of individual adventurers, was by these princes, several times, parted<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_021" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_021_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> out and distributed among the favourites and<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_022" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_022_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> followers of their fortunes, and, by an assumed right to the crown alone, were<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_023" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_023_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> erected into distinct and independent governments; a measure which it is believed his Majesty&#x2019;s prudence and understanding would prevent him from imitating at this day, as no exercise of such power, of dividing and dismembering a country, has ever occurred in his Majesty&#x2019;s realm of England, though now of very ancient standing; nor could it be justified or <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>68<span class="bracket">]</span></span> acquiesced under there, or in any other part of his Majesty&#x2019;s empire.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_97">That the exercise of a free trade with all parts of the world, possessed by the American colonists, as of natural right, and which no law of their own had taken away or abridged, was next the object of unjust encroachment. Some of the colonies having thought proper to continue the administration of their government in the name and under the authority of his Majesty King Charles the First, whom, notwithstanding his late deposition by the commonwealth of England, they continued in the sovereignty of their state; the Parliament for the commonwealth took the same in high offence, and assumed upon themselves the power of prohibiting their trade with all other parts of the world, except the island of Great Britain. This arbitrary act, however, they soon recalled, and by [9] solemn treaty, entered into on the 12th day of March, 1651, between the said commonwealth by their commissioners, and the colony of Virginia by their house of burgesses, it was expressly stipulated, by the 8th article of the said treaty, that they should have &#x201C;free trade as the people of England do enjoy to all places and with all nations, according to the laws of that commonwealth.&#x201D; But that, upon the restoration of his majesty king Charles the second, their rights of free commerce fell once more a victim to arbitrary power; and by several acts<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_024" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_024_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> of his reign, as well as of some of his successors, the trade of the colonies was laid <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>69<span class="bracket">]</span></span> under such restrictions as shew what hopes they might form from the justice of a British Parliament, were its uncontrouled power admitted over these states. History has informed us that bodies of men, as well as individuals, are susceptible of the spirit of tyranny. A view of these acts of parliament for regulation, as it has been affectedly called, of the American trade, if all other evidence were removed out of the case, would undeniably evince the truth of this observation. Besides the duties they impose on our articles of export and import, they prohibit our going to any markets northward of Cape Finisterre, in the kingdom of Spain, for the sale of commodities which Great Britain will not take from us, and for the purchase of others, with which she cannot supply us, and that for no other than the arbitrary purposes of purchasing for themselves, by a sacrifice of our rights and interests, certain privileges in their commerce with an allied state, who in confidence that their exclusive trade with America will be continued, while the principles and power of the British parliament be the same, have indulged themselves in every exorbitance which their avarice could dictate, or our necessities extort; have raised their commodities called for in America, to the double and treble of what they sold for before such exclusive privileges were given them, and of what better commodities of the same kind would cost us elsewhere, and at the [10] same time give us much less for what we could carry thither than might be had at more convenient ports. That these acts prohibit us from carrying in quest of other purchasers the surplus of our tobaccoes <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>70<span class="bracket">]</span></span> remaining after the consumption of Great Britain is supplied; so that we must leave them with the British merchant for whatever he will please to allow us, to be by him reshipped to foreign markets, where he will reap the benefits of making sale of them for full value. That to heighten still the idea of parliamentary justice, and to shew with what moderation they are like to exercise power, where themselves are to feel no part of its weight, we take leave to mention to his majesty certain other acts of British parliament, by which they would prohibit us from manufacturing for our own use the articles we raise on our own lands with our own labour. By an act<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_025" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_025_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> passed in the 5th year of the reign of his late majesty king George the second, an American subject is forbidden to make a hat for himself of the fur which he has taken perhaps on his own soil; an instance of despotism to which no parallel can be produced in the most arbitrary ages of British history. By one other act<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_026" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_026_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> passed in the 23d year of the same reign, the iron which we make we are forbidden to manufacture, and heavy as that article is, and necessary in every branch of husbandry, besides commission and insurance, we are to pay freight for it to Great Britain, and freight for it back again, for the purpose of supporting not men, but machines, in the island of Great Britain. In the same spirit of equal and impartial legislation is to be viewed the act of parliament<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_027" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_027_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> passed in the 5th year of the same reign, by which American lands are made subject to the demands of British creditors, while their own lands were still <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>71<span class="bracket">]</span></span> continued unanswerable for their debts; from which one of these conclusions must necessarily follow, either that justice is not the same in America as in Britain, or else that the British parliament pay less regard to it here than there. But that we do not point out to his majesty the injustice of these acts, with intent to rest on that principle the cause of their [11] nullity; but to shew that experience confirms the propriety of those political principles which exempt us from the jurisdiction of the British parliament. The true ground on which we declare these acts void is, that the British parliament has no right to exercise its authority over us.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_98">That these exercises of usurped power have not been confined to instances alone, in which themselves were interested, but they have also intermeddled with the regulation of the internal affairs of the colonies. The act of the 9th of Anne for establishing a post office in America seems to have had little connection with British convenience, except that of accommodating his majesty&#x2019;s ministers and favourites with the sale of a lucrative and easy office.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_99">That thus we have hastened through the reigns which preceded his majesty&#x2019;s during which the violations of our rights were less alarming, because repeated at more distant intervals than that rapid and bold succession of injuries which is likely to distinguish the present from all other periods of American story. Scarcely have our minds been able to emerge from the astonishment into which one stroke of parliamentary thunder had involved us, before another more heavy, and more alarming, is fallen on us. Single <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>72<span class="bracket">]</span></span> acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a day; but a series of oppressions begun at a distinguished period, and pursued, unalterably through every change of ministers, too plainly prove a deliberate and systematical plan of reducing us to slavery.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_100">That the act,<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_028" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_028_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> passed in the 4th year of his majesty&#x2019;s reign, entitled &#x201C;An act for granting certain duties in the British colonies and plantations in America, &amp;c.&#x201D;</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_103">But that one other act,<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_032" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_032_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> passed in the same 7th year of the<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_033" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_033_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> reign, having been a peculiar attempt, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>73<span class="bracket">]</span></span> must ever require peculiar mention; it is entitled &#x201C;An act for suspending the legislature of New York.&#x201D; One free and independent legislature hereby takes upon itself to suspend the powers of another, free and independent as itself; this exhibiting a ph&#x153;nomenon unknown in nature, the creator and creature of his own power. Not only the principles of common sense, but the common<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_034" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_034_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> feelings of human nature, must be surrendered up before his majesty&#x2019;s subjects here can be persuaded to believe that they hold their political existence at the will of a British parliament. Shall these governments be dissolved, their property annihilated, and their people reduced to a state of nature, at the imperious breath of a body of men, whom they never saw, in whom they never confided, and over whom they have no powers of punishment or removal, let their crimes against the American public be ever so great? Can any one reason be assigned why 160,000 electors in the island of Great Britain should give law to four millions in the states of America, every individual of whom is equal to every individual of them, in virtue, in understanding, and in bodily strength? Were this to be admitted, instead of being a free people, as we have hitherto supposed, and mean to continue ourselves, we should suddenly be found the slaves not of one but of 160,000 tyrants, distinguished too from all others by this singular circumstance, that they are removed [13] from the reach of fear, the only restraining motive which may hold<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_035" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_035_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> the hand of a tyrant.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>74<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_104">That by &#x201C;an act<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_036" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_036_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> to discontinue in such manner and for such time as they are therein mentioned, the landing and discharging, lading or shipping, of goods, wares, and merchandize, at the town and within the harbour of Boston, in the province of Massachusetts Bay, in North America&#x201D; which was passed at the last session of British parliament; a large and populous town, whose trade was their sole subsistence, was deprived of that trade, and involved in utter ruin. Let us for a while suppose the question of right suspended, in order to examine this act on principles of justice: An act of parliament had been passed imposing duties on teas, to be paid in America, against which act the Americans had protested as inauthoritative. The East India Company, who till that time had never sent a pound of tea to America on their own account, step forth on that occasion the assertors of parliamentary right, and send hither many ship loads of that obnoxious commodity. The masters of their several vessels, however, on their arrival to America, wisely attended to admonition, and returned with their cargoes. In the province of New England<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_037" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_037_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> alone the remonstrances of the people were disregarded, and a compliance, after being many days waited for, was flatly refused. Whether in this the master of the vessel was governed by his obstinacy, or his instructions, let those who know say. There are extraordinary situations which require extraordinary interposition. An exasperated people, who feel that they possess power, are not easily restrained <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>75<span class="bracket">]</span></span> within limits strictly regular. A number of them assembled in the town of Boston, threw the tea into the ocean, and dispersed without doing any other act of violence. If in this they did wrong, they were known and were amenable to the laws of the land, against which it could not be objected that they had ever, in any instance, been obstructed or diverted from their regular course in favour of popular offenders. They should therefore not have been distrusted on this occasion. [14] But that ill fated colony had formerly been bold in their enmities against the house of Stuart, and were now devoted to ruin by that unseen hand which governs the momentous affairs of this great empire. On the partial representations of a few worthless ministerial dependants, whose constant office it has been to keep that government embroiled, and who, by their treacheries, hope to obtain the dignity of the British knighthood,<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_038" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_038_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> without calling for the party accused, without asking a proof, without attempting a distinction between the guilty and the innocent, the whole of that ancient and wealthy town is in a moment reduced from opulence to beggary. Men who had spent their lives in extending the British commerce, who had invested in that place the wealth their honest endeavors had merited, found themselves and their families thrown at once on the world for subsistence by its charities. Not the hundredth part of the inhabitants of that town had been concerned in the act complained of, many of them were in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>76<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Great Britain and in other parts beyond sea, yet all were involved in one indiscriminate ruin, by a new executive power unheard of till then, that of a British Parliament. A property, of the value of many millions of money, was sacrificed to revenge, not repay, the loss of a few thousands. This is administering justice with a heavy hand indeed! and when is this tempest to be arrested in its course? Two wharfs are to be opened again when his Majesty shall think proper. The residue, which lined the extensive shores of the bay of Boston, are forever interdicted the exercise of commerce. This little exception seems to have been thrown in for no other purpose than that of setting a precedent for investing his majesty with legislative powers. If the pulse of his people shall beat calmly under this experiment, another and another shall be tried, till the measure of despotism be filled up. It would be an insult on common sense to pretend that this exception was made in order to restore its commerce to that great town. The trade which cannot be received at two wharfs alone must of necessity be transferred to some other place; to which [15] it will soon be followed by that of the two wharfs. Considered in this light, it would be insolent and cruel mockery at the annihilation of the town of Boston.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_105">By the act<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_039" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_039_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> for the suppression of riots and tumults in the town of Boston, passed also in the last session of parliament, a murder committed there is, if the governor pleases, to be tried in a court of King&#x2019;s Bench, in the island of Great Britain, by a jury of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>77<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Middlesex. The witnesses, too, on receipt of such a sum as the governor shall think it reasonable for them to expend, are to enter into recognizance to appear at the trial. This is, in other words, taxing them to the moment of their recognizance, and that amount may be whatever a governor pleases; for who does his majesty think can be prevailed on to cross the Atlantic for the sole purpose of bearing evidence to a fact? His expences are to be borne, indeed, as they shall be estimated by a governor; but who are to feed the wife and children whom he leaves behind and who have had no other subsistence but his daily labour? Those epidemical disorders too, so terrible in a foreign climate, is the cure of them to be estimated among the articles of expence, and their danger to be warded off by the almighty power of parliament? And the wretched criminal, if he happen to have offended on the American side, stripped of his privilege of trial by peers of his vicinage, removed from the place where alone full evidence could be obtained, without money, without council, without friends, without exculpatory proof, is tried before judges predetermined to condemn. The cowards who would suffer a countryman to be torn from the bowels of their society, in order to be thus offered a sacrifice to parliamentary tyranny, would merit that everlasting infamy now fixed on the authors of the act! A clause<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_040" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_040_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> for a similar purpose had been introduced into an act passed in the twelfth year of his majesty&#x2019;s reign, entitled &#x201C;An act for the better securing and preserving his majesty&#x2019;s dockyards, magazines, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>78<span class="bracket">]</span></span> ships, ammunition and stores,&#x201D; against which, as [16] meriting the same censures, the several colonies have already protested.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_106">That these are acts of power, assumed by a body of men, foreign to our constitutions, and unacknowledged by our laws, against which we do, on behalf of the inhabitants of British America, enter this our solemn and determined protest; and we do earnestly entreat his majesty, as yet the only mediatory power between the several states of the British empire, to recommend to his parliament of Great Britain the total revocation of these acts, which, however nugatory they may yet prove the cause of further discontents and jealousies among us.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_107">That we next proceed to consider the conduct of his majesty, as holding the executive powers of the laws of these states, and mark out his deviations from the line of duty. By the constitution of Great Britain, as well of the several American states, his majesty professes the power of refusing to pass into a law any bill which has already passed the other two branches of legislature. His majesty, however, and his ancestors, conscious of the impropriety of opposing their single opinion to the united wisdom of two houses of parliament, while their proceedings were unbiassed by interested principles, for several ages past have modestly declined the exercise of this power in that part of his empire called Great Britain. But by change of circumstances, other principles than those of justice simply obtained an influence on their determinations; the addition of new states to the British empire has produced an addition of new, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>79<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and sometimes opposite interests. It is now, therefore, the great office of his majesty, to resume exercise of his negative power, and to prevent the passage of laws by any one legislature of the empire, which might bear injuriously on the rights and interests of another. Yet this will not excuse the wanton exercise of this power which we have seen his Majesty practise on the laws of the American legislatures. For the most trifling reasons, and sometimes for no conceivable reason at all, his majesty has rejected laws of the most salutary tendency. The abolition of do-[17]mestic slavery is the great object of desire in those colonies,where it was unhappily introduced in their infant state. But previous to the enfranchisement of the slaves we have, it is necessary to exclude all further importations from Africa; yet our repeated attempts to effect this by prohibitions, and by imposing duties which might amount to a prohibition, have been hitherto defeated by his majesty&#x2019;s negative: Thus preferring the immediate advantages of a few African<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_041" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_041_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> corsairs to the lasting interests of the American states, and to the rights of human nature deeply wounded by this infamous practice. Nay, the single interposition of an interested individual against a law was scarcely ever known to fail of success, though in the opposite scale were placed the interests of the whole country. That this is so shameful an abuse of a power trusted with his majesty for other purposes, as if not reformed, would call for some legal restrictions.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_108">With equal inattention to the necessities of his <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>80<span class="bracket">]</span></span> people here has his Majesty permitted our laws to lie neglected in England for years, neither confirming them by his assent, nor annulling them by his negative; so that such of them as have no suspending clause we hold on the most precarious of all tenures, his majesty&#x2019;s will and such of them as suspend themselves till his majesty&#x2019;s assent be obtained, we have feared, might be called into existence at some future and distant period, when the time and change of circumstances shall have rendered them destructive to his people here. And to render this aggrievance still more oppressive, his majesty by his instructions has laid his governors under such restrictions that they can pass no law of any moment unless it have such suspending clause; so that, however immediate may be the call for legislative interposition, the law cannot be executed till it has twice crossed the Atlantic, by which time the evil may have spent its whole force.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_109">But in what terms, reconcileable to majesty, and at the same time to truth, shall we speak of a late instruction to his majesty&#x2019;s<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_042" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_042_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> governor of the colony of Virginia, by which he is forbidden to assent to any law for the division of a county, unless the new county [18] will consent to have no representative in assembly? That colony has as yet fixed no boundary to the westward. Their westward counties, therefore, are of indefinite extent; some of them are actually seated many hundred miles from their eastward limits. Is it possible, then, that his majesty can <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>81<span class="bracket">]</span></span> have bestowed a single thought on the situation of those people, who, in order to obtain justice for injuries, however great or small, must, by the laws of that colony, attend their county court, at such a distance, with all their witnesses, monthly, till their litigation be determined? Or does his majesty seriously wish, and publish it to the world, that his subjects should give up the glorious right of representation, with all the benefits derived from that, and submit themselves the absolute slaves of his sovereign will? Or is it rather meant to confine the legislative body to their present numbers, that they may be the cheaper bargain whenever they shall become worth a purchase.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_110">One of the articles of impeachment against Trestlain, and the other judges of Westminister-Hall, in the reign of Richard the second, for which they suffered death, as traitors to their country, was, that they had advised the king that he might dissolve his parliament at any time; and succeeding kings have adopted the opinion of these unjust judges. Since the establishment,<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_043" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_043_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> however, of<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_044" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_044_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> the British constitution, at the glorious revolution,<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_045" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_045_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> on its free and antient principles, neither his majesty, nor his ancestors, have exercised such a power of dissolution in the island of Great Britain; and when his majesty was petitioned, by the united voice of his people there, to dissolve the present parliament, who had become <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>82<span class="bracket">]</span></span> obnoxious to them, his ministers were heard to declare in open parliament, that his majesty possessed no such power by the constitution.<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_046" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_046_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> But how different their language and his practice here! To declare, as their duty required, the known rights of their country, to oppose the usurpations of every foreign judicature, to disregard the imperious mandates of a minister or governor, have been the avowed causes of dissolving houses of representatives in America. But if such powers be [19] really vested in his majesty, can he suppose they are there placed to awe the members from such purposes as these? When the representative body have lost their confidence of their constituents, when they have notoriously made sale of their most valuable rights, when they have assumed to themselves powers which the people never put into their hands, then indeed their continuing in office becomes dangerous to the state, and calls for an exercise of the power of dissolution. Such being the causes for which the representative body should, and should not be dissolved, will it not appear strange to an unbiased observer, that that of Great Britain was not dissolved, while those of the colonies have repeatedly incurred that sentence?</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>83<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_111">But your majesty, or your governors, have carried this power beyond every limit known, or provided for, by the laws: After dissolving one house of representatives, they have refused to call another, so that for a great length of time, the legislature provided by the laws has been out of existence. From the nature of things, every society must at all times possess within itself the sovereign powers of legislation. The feelings of human nature revolt against the supposition of a state so situated as that it may not in any emergency provide against dangers which perhaps threatened immediate ruin. While those bodies are in existence to whom the people have delegated the powers of legislation, they alone possess and may exercise those powers; but when they are dissolved by the lopping off one or more of their branches, the power reverts to the people, who may exercise it to unlimited extent, either assembling together in person, sending deputies, or in any other way they may think proper.<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_047" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_047_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> We forbear to trace consequences further; the dangers are conspicuous with which this practice is replete.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_112">That we shall at this time take notice of an error in the nature of our land holdings, which crept in at a very early period of our settlement. The introduction of the feudal tenures into the kingdom of England, though ancient, is well enough understood to set this matter in a proper light. In the earlier ages <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>84<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of the Saxon settlement feudal holdings were [20] certainly altogether unknown; and very few, if any, had been introduced at the time of the Norman conquest. Our Saxon ancestors held their lands, as they did their personal property, in absolute dominion, disencumbered with any superior, answering nearly to the nature of those possessions which the feudalists term allodial. William, the Norman, first introduced that system generally. The land which had belonged to those who fell in the battle of Hastings, and in the subsequent insurrections of his reign, formed a considerable proportion of the lands of the whole kingdom. These he granted out, subject to feudal duties, as did he also those of a great number of his new subjects, who, by persuasions or threats, were induced to surrender them for that purpose. But still much was left in the hands of his Saxon subjects; held of no superior and not subject to feudal conditions. These, therefore, by express laws, enacted to render uniform the system of military defence, were made liable to the same military duties as if they had been feuds; and the Norman lawyers soon found means to saddle them also with all the other feudal burthens. But still they had not been surrendered to the king, they were not derived from his grant, and therefore they were not holden of him. A general principle indeed, was introduced, that &#x201C;all lands in England were held either mediately or immediately of the crown,&#x201D; but this was borrowed from those holdings, which were truly feudal, and only applied to others for the purposes of illustration. Feudal holdings were therefore but exceptions out of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>85<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Saxon laws of possession, under which all lands were held in absolute right. These, therefore, still form the basis, or groundwork, of the common law, to prevail wheresoever the exceptions have taken place. America was not conquered by William the Norman, nor its lands surrendered to him, or any of his successors. Possessions there are undoubtedly of the allodial nature. Our ancestors, however, who emigrated hither, were farmers,<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_048" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_048_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> not lawyers. The fictitious principle that all lands belong originally to the king, they were early persuaded to believe [21] real; and accordingly took grants of their own lands from the crown. And while the crown continued to grant for small sums, and on reasonable rents, there was no inducement to arrest the error, and lay it open to the public view. But his majesty has lately taken on him to advance the terms of purchase, and of holding to the double of what they were, by which means the acquisition of lands being rendered difficult, the population of our country is likely to be checked. It is time, therefore, for us to lay this matter before his majesty, and to declare that he has no right to grant lands of himself. From the nature and purpose of civil institutions, all the lands within the limits which any particular society has circumscribed around itself are assumed by that society, and subject to their allotment only. This may be done by themselves assembled collectively, or by their legislature, to whom they may have delegated sovereign authority; and if they are alloted in either of these ways, each individual of the society may appropriate to himself <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>86<span class="bracket">]</span></span> such lands as he finds vacant, and occupancy will give him title.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_113">That in order to force the arbitrary measures before complained of, his majesty has from time to time sent among us large bodies of armed forces, not made up of the people here, nor raised by the authority of our laws. Did his majesty possess such a right as this, it might swallow up all our other rights whenever he should think proper. But his majesty has no right to land a single armed man on our shores, and those whom he sends here are liable to our laws made for the suppression and punishment of riots, and unlawful assemblies; or are hostile bodies, invading us in defiance of the law. When in the course of the late war it became expedient that a body of Hanoverian troops should be brought over for the defence of Great Britain, his majesty&#x2019;s grandfather, our late sovereign, did not pretend to introduce them under any authority he possessed. Such a measure would have given just alarm to his subjects in Great Britain, whose liberties would not be safe if armed men of another country, and of another spirit, might be brought into the realm at any time without the con-[22]sent of their legislature. He therefore applied to parliament, who passed an act for that purpose, limiting the number to be brought in, and the time they were to continue. In like manner is his majesty restrained in every part of the empire. He possesses, indeed, the executive power of the laws in every state, but they are the laws of the particular state which he is to administer within that state, and not those of any one within the limits of another. Every <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>87<span class="bracket">]</span></span> state must judge for itself the number of armed men which they may safely trust among them, of whom they are to consist, and under what restrictions they shall be laid.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_114">To render these proceedings still more criminal against our laws, instead of subjecting the military to the civil powers, his majesty has expressly made the civil subordinate to the military. But can his majesty thus put down all law under his feet? Can he erect a power superior to that which erected himself? He has done it indeed by force, but let him remember that force cannot give right.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_115">That these are our grievances which we have thus laid before his majesty, with that freedom of language and sentiment which becomes a free people claiming their rights, as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their chief magistrate: Let those flatter who fear, it is not an American art. To give praise which is not due might be well from the venal, but would ill beseem those who are asserting the rights of human nature. They know, and will therefore say, that kings are the servants, not the proprietors of the people. Open your breast, sire, to liberal and expanded thought. Let not the name of George the third be a blot in the page of history. Your are surrounded by English counsellors, but remember that they are parties. You have no minister for American affairs, because you have none taken up from among us, nor amenable to the laws on which they are to give you advice. It behooves you, therefore, to think and to act for yourself and your people. The great principles of right and wrong are <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>88<span class="bracket">]</span></span> legible to every reader; to pursue them requires not the aid of many counsellors. The whole art of government consists [23] in the art of being honest. Only aim to do your duty, and mankind will give you credit where you fail. No longer persevere in sacrificing the rights of one part of the empire to the inordinate desires of another; but deal out to all equal and impartial right. Let no act be passed by any one legislature which may infringe on the rights and liberties of another. This is the important post in which fortune has placed you, holding the balance of a great, if a well poised empire. This, sire, is the advice of your great American council, on the observance of which may perhaps depend your felicity and future fame, and the preservation of that harmony which alone can continue both in Great Britain and America the reciprocal advantages of their connection. It is neither our wish nor our interest to separate from her. We are willing, on our part, to sacrifice everything which reason can ask to the restoration of that tranquillity for which all must wish. On their part, let them be ready to establish union and<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_049" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_049_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> a generous plan. Let them name their terms, but let them be just. Accept of every commercial preference it is in our power to give for such things as we can raise for their use, or they make for ours. But let them not think to exclude us from going to other markets to dispose of those commodities which they cannot use, or to supply those wants which they cannot supply. Still less let it be proposed that our properties within our own territories <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>89<span class="bracket">]</span></span> shall be taxed or regulated by any power on earth but our own. The God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time; the hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them. This, sire, is our last, our determined resolution; and that you will be pleased to interpose with that efficacy which your earnest endeavors may ensure to procure redress of these our great grievances to quiet the minds of your subjects in British America, against any apprehensions of future encroachment, to establish fraternal love and harmony through the whole empire, and that these may continue to the last ages of time, is the fervent prayer of all British America.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_127">&#x2014;As I mean to be a conscientious observer of the measures generally thought requisite for the preservation of our independent rights, so I think myself bound to account to my country for any act of mine which might wear an appearance of contravening them. I therefore take the liberty of stating to you the following matter that thro your friendly intervention it may be communicated to the committee of your country. You may remember it was about the last of May that the house of Burgesses after it&#x2019;s dissolution met in the Raleigh and formed our first association<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_051" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_051_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> against the future use of tea only, tho&#x2019; the proceedings of the ministry against the town of Boston were then well known to us. I believe nobody thought at that time of extending our association further to the total interruption of our commerce with Britain; or if it was proposed by any (which I do not recollect) it was condemned by the general sense of the members who formed that association. Two or three days therefore after this I wrote to Cary &amp; co. of London for 14 pr of sash Windows, to be sent me ready made &amp; glazed with a small parcel of spare glass to mend with. This letter went <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>95<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by a ship which sailed abt the 3d. of June just before Power arrived here, &amp; I did not suppose they would send them till Power should come in again in the spring of 1775. About the middle of June as nearly as I can recollect, a few of the late members were again convened (in consequence of fresh advices from Boston) and then it was suggested a more extensive association might be necessary. A convention met for that purpose the first of August and formed a new association: of which I received a copy about the 11th of the month. But as a General congress was appointed to be held within four weeks of that time to reconsider the same matters and it was agreed that our Association should be subject to any alterations that they might recommend I did not write to countermand my order, thinking I should have sufficient time after the final determinations of the congress should be known, to countermand it before Power should sail in the spring. Accordly within a few days after receiving a copy of the general association I wrote to Cary &amp; co. not to send the sashes, glass &amp;c. which I had ordered &amp; gave my letter to the care of a gentleman (Mr. Evans) just then going downward who promised to send it out speedily, but three or four days after I received a letter from those gentl. dated Aug. 29 in which they informed me my window frames and glass are ready but that it being necessary to detain them about a month to harden the puttying, they were not sent by that but might be expected by the first ship afterwards. From this I conclude they may be near arriving at this time, in which case they will come under the 1st &amp; 10th <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>96<span class="bracket">]</span></span> articles of the Association. In order therefore that no proceeding of mine might give a handle for traducing our measures I thought it better previously to lay before your committee, (within whose ward they will probably be landed) a full state of the matter by which it might be seen under what expectations I had failed to give an earlier countermand and to shew that as they come under the prohibitions of the Continental association (which without the spirit of prophecy could not have been foretold when I ordered them) so I mean they shall be subject to it&#x2019;s condemnation. To your committee therefore if landed within their county I submit the disposal of them which shall be obeyed as soon as made known to their and your most humble servt.</p>

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_135">&#x2014;Within this week we have received the unhappy news of an action of considerable magnitude, between the King&#x2019;s troops and our brethren of Boston, in which it is said five hundred of the former, with the Earl of Percy, are slain.<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_057" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_057_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> That such an action has occurred, is undoubted, though perhaps the circumstances may not have reached us with truth. This accident has cut off our last hope of reconciliation, and a phrensy of revenge seems to have seized all ranks of people. It is a lamentable circumstance, that the only mediatory power, acknowledged by both parties, instead of leading to a reconciliation of his divided people, should pursue the incendiary purpose of still blowing up the flames, as we find him constantly doing, in every speech and public declaration. This may, perhaps, be intended to intimidate into acquiescence, but the effect has been most <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>100<span class="bracket">]</span></span> unfortunately otherwise. A little knowledge of human nature, and attention to its ordinary workings, might have foreseen that the spirits of the people here were in a state, in which they were more likely to be provoked, than frightened, by haughty deportment. And to fill up the measure of irritation, a proscription of individuals has been substituted in the room of just trial. Can it be believed, that a grateful people will suffer those to be consigned to execution, whose sole crime has been the developing and asserting their rights? Had the Parliament possessed the power of reflection, they would have avoided a measure as impotent, as it was inflammatory. When I saw Lord Chatham&#x2019;s bill, I entertained high hope that a reconciliation could have been brought about. The difference between his terms, and those offered by our Congress, might have been accommodated, if entered on, by both parties, with a disposition to accommodate. But the dignity of Parliament, it seems, can brook no opposition to its power. Strange, that a set of men, who have made sale of their virtue to the Minister, should yet talk of retaining dignity! But I am getting into politics, though I sat down only to ask your acceptance of the wine, and express my constant wishes for your happiness.</p>

<div class="dateline">Monday, <div class="date 1775-06-12">June 12, 15 Geo. III., 1775</div>.</div>
<div class="salute csc">My Lord:</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_136">&#x2014;We, His majesty&#x2019;s dutiful and loyal subjects, the Burgesses of Virginia, now met in General Assembly, have taken into our consideration the joint Address of the two Houses of Parliament, His Majesty&#x2019;s Answer, and the Resolution of the Commons, which your Lordship has been pleased to lay before us. Wishing nothing so sincerely as the perpetual continuance of that brotherly love which we bear to our fellow-subjects of Great Britain, and still continuing to hope and believe that they do not approve the measures which have so long oppressed their brethren in America, we were pleased to receive your Lordship&#x2019;s notification, that a benevolent tender had at length been made by the British House of Commons towards bringing to a good end our unhappy disputes with the Mother Country. Next to the possession of liberty, my Lord, we should consider such a reconcilliation as the greatest of all human blessings. With these dispositions we entered into the consideration of that Resolution; we examined it minutely; we viewed it in every point <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>102<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of light in which we were able to place it; and, with pain and disappointment, we must ultimately declare it only changes the form of oppression, without lightening its burden. We cannot, my Lord, close with the terms of that Resolution, for these reasons:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_137">Because the British Parliament has no right to intermeddle with the support of civil Government in the Colonies. For us, not for them, has Government been instituted here. Agreeable to our ideas, provision has been made for such officers as we think necessary for the administration of publick affairs; and we cannot conceive that any other legislature has a right to prescribe either the number or pecuniary appointments of our offices. As a proof that the claim of Parliament to interfere in the necessary provisions for the support of civil Government is novel, and of a late date, we take leave to refer to an Act of our Assembly, passed so long since as the thirty second year of the reign of King Charles the Second, intituled, &#x201C;An Act for raising a publick revenue, and for the better support of the Government of His Majesty&#x2019;s Colony of Virginia.&#x201D; This act was brought over by Lord Culpeper, then Governour, under the great seal of England, and was enacted in the name of the &#x201C;King&#x2019;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the consent of the General Assembly.&#x201D;</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_138">Because to render perpetual our exemption from an unjust taxation, we must saddle ourselves with a perpetual tax, adequate to the expectations, and subject to the disposal of Parliament alone; Whereas we have a right to give our money, as the Parliament do theirs, without coercion, from time to time, as <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>103<span class="bracket">]</span></span> publick exigences may require. We conceive that we alone are the judges of the condition, circumstances, and situation of our people, as the Parliament are of theirs. It is not merely the mode of raising, but the freedom of granting our money, for which we have contended. Without this, we possess no check on the royal prerogative; and what must be lamented by dutiful and loyal subjects, we should be stripped of the only means, as well of recommending this country to the favours of our most gracious Sovereign, as of strengthening those bands of amity with our fellow-subjects, which we would wish to remain indissoluble.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_139">Because on our undertaking to grant money, as is proposed, the Commons only resolve to forbear levying pecuniary taxes on us, still leaving unrepealed their several Acts passed for the purposes of restraining the Trade, and altering the form of Government of the Eastern Colonies; extending the boundaries, and changing the Government and Religion of Quebeck; enlarging the jurisdiction of the Courts of Admiralty; taking from us the right of Trial by Jury, and transporting us into other countries to be tried for criminal offences. Standing Armies, too, are still to be kept among us, and the other numerous grievances, of which ourselves and sister Colonies, separately and by our Representatives in General Congress, have so often complained, are still to continue without redress.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_140">Because at the very time of requiring from us grants of money, they are making disposition to invade us with large armaments by sea and land, which <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>104<span class="bracket">]</span></span> is a style of asking gifts not reconcilable to our freedom. They are also proceeding to a repetition of injury, by passing Acts for restraining the Commerce and Fisheries of the Provinces of New England, and for prohibiting the Trade of the other Colonies with all parts of the world, except the Island of Great Britain, Ireland, and the West Indies. This seems to bespeak no intention to discontinue the exercise of this usurped power over us in future.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_141">Because on our agreeing to contribute our proportion towards the common defence, they do not propose to lay open to us a free trade with all the world: whereas, to us it appears just that those who bear equally the burdens of Government should equally participate of its benefits; either be contented with the monopoly of our trade, which brings greater loss to us and benefit to them than the amount of our proportional contributions to the common defence; or, if the latter be preferred, relinquish the former, and do not propose, by holding both, to exact from us double contributions. Yet we would remind Government, that on former emergencies, when called upon as a free people, however cramped by this monopoly in our resources of wealth, we have liberally contributed to the common defence. Be assured, then, that we shall be as generous in future as in past times, disclaiming the shackles of proportion when called to our free station in the general system of the empire.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_142">Because the proposition now made to us involves the interests of all the other Colonies. We are now represented in General Congress by members approved <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>105<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by this House, where the former union, it is hoped, will be so strongly cemented, that no partial applications can produce the slightest departure from the common cause. We consider ourselves as bound in honour, as well as interest, to share one general fate with our sister Colonies; and should hold ourselves base deserters of that union to which we have acceded, were we to agree on any measures distinct and apart from them.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_143">There was, indeed, a plan of accommodation offered in Parliament, which, though not entirely equal to the terms we had a right to ask, yet differed but in few points from what the General Congress had held out. Had Parliament been disposed sincerely, as we are, to bring about a reconciliation, reasonable men had hoped, that by meeting us on this ground, something might have been done. Lord Chatham&#x2019;s Bill, on the one part, and the terms of Congress on the other, would have formed a basis for negotiations, which a spirit of accommodation on both sides might, perhaps, have reconciled. It came recommended, too, from one whose successful experience in the art of Government should have insured it some attention from those to whom it was intended. He had shown to the world, that Great Britain, with her Colonies united firmly under a just and honest Government, formed a power which might bid defiance to the most potent enemies. With a change of Ministers, however, a total change of measures took place. The component parts of the Empire have, from that moment, been falling asunder, and a total annihilation of its weight in the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>106<span class="bracket">]</span></span> political scale of the world, seems justly to be apprehended.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_144">These, my Lord, are our sentiments on this important subject, which we offer only as an individual part of the whole Empire. Final determination we leave to the General Congress, now sitting, before whom we shall lay the papers your Lordship has communicated to us. To their wisdom we commit the improvement of this important advance; if it can be wrought into any good, we were assured they will do it. To them, also, we refer the discovery of that proper method of representing our well-founded grievances, which your Lordship assures us will meet with the attention and regard so justly due to them. For ourselves, we have exhausted every mode of application which our invention could suggest as proper and promising. We have decently remonstrated with Parliament: they have added new injuries to the old. We have wearied our King with applications: he has not deigned to answer us. We have appealed to the native honour and justice of the British Nation. Their efforts in our favour have been hitherto ineffectual. What, then, remains to be done? That we commit our injuries to the evenhanded justice of the Being who doth no wrong, earnestly beseeching him to illuminate the counsels, and prosper the endeavours of those to whom America hath confided her hopes, that through their wise direction we may again see reunited the blessings of liberty, property, and harmony with Great Britain.</p>

The enemy has certainly 500 wounded and the same account supposes that number killed; but judging from the proportion of wounded and slain on our part, they should not have perhaps above two hundred killed. This happened on Saturday, and on Monday, when the express came away, the provincials had begun to make another attack. Washington set out from here on Friday last as generalissimo of all the provincial troops in North America. Ward and Lee were appointed major-generals and Gates adjutant. We are exceedingly anxious till we hear of their arrival at Boston, as it is evident to every one that the provincial encampment is the most injudicious that can possibly be conceived. For the sole purpose of covering two small towns near Boston they have encamped so near the line of the ministerial <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>108<span class="bracket">]</span></span> army that the sentries may converse. Gage, too, being well fortified, is in little danger of an attack from them; while their situation is such that he may attack them when he pleases, and if he is unsuccessful, they cannot pursue him a foot scarcely, on account of the ships and floating batteries bearing on the Neck of Boston. If no evil arises from this till General Washington arrives, we may expect to hear of his withdrawing the provincial troops to a greater distance. The Congress have directed 20,000 men to be raised, and hope by a vigorous campaign to dispose our enemies to treaty. Governor Carleton has been spiriting up the Canadian Indians to fall on our back settlements; but this we hope will be prevented. Governor Skeene, appointed to take charge of the fortresses on the lakes, was intercepted here, as we had already taken possession of those fortifications and provided a governor, there was no occasion for him to proceed. He is now, therefore, our prisoner. My best affections attend Mrs. Eppes and family.</p>

<div class="salute csc">Dear Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_146">&#x2014;Since my last, nothing new has happened. Our accounts of the battle of Charleston have become clear, and greatly to our satisfaction. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>109<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Contrary to what usually happens, the first account were below truth; and it is now certain that the regulars have had between 1200 and 1400 killed and wounded in that engagement, and that of these 500 were killed. Major Pitcairn is among the slain, at which everybody rejoices, as he was the commanding officer at Lexington, was the first who fired his own piece there and gave the command to fire. Among those was a Doctor Warren, a man who seems to have been immensely valued at the North. The New-Englanders are fitting out light vessels of war, by which it is hoped we shall not only clear the seas and bays here of everything below the size of a ship of war, but that they will visit the coasts of Europe and distress the British trade in every part of the world. The adventurous genius and intrepidity of those people is amazing. They are now intent on burning Boston as a hive which gives cover to regulars; and none are more bent upon it than the very people who came out of it and whose prosperity lies there. This however, if done at all, it is thought better to defer till the cold season is coming on, as it would then lay them under irremediable distress. Powder seems now to be our only difficulty, and towards getting plenty of that nothing is wanting but saltpetre. If we can weather out this campaign, I hope that we shall be able to have a plenty made for another. Nothing is requisite but to set about it, as every colony has materials, but more especially Virginia and Maryland. My compliments most affectionately to Mrs. Eppes. Mr. and Mrs. Skipwith, I expect, have left you. Adieu.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_147">The large <del class="strike">advances</del> strides of late taken by the legislature of Great Britain towards <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>111<span class="bracket">]</span></span> establishing <del class="strike">in</del> over these colonies their absolute rule, and the hardiness of their present attempt to effect by force of arms what by law or right they could never effect, renders it necessary for us also to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>112<span class="bracket">]</span></span> <del class="strike">shift</del> change the ground of opposition and to close with their last appeal from reason to arms. And as it behoves those who are called to this great decision to be assured that their cause is approved before supreme reason, so is it of great avail that its justice be made known to the world whose <del class="strike">prayers cannot be wanting intercessions</del> affections will ever <del class="strike">be favorable to a people</del> take part with those encountring oppression. Our forefathers, inhabitants of the island of Gr. Britn <del class="strike">harassed</del> having <del class="strike">there vainly</del> long endeavored to bear up against the evils of misrule, left their native land to seek on these shores a residence for civil &amp; religious freedom. At the expense of their blood, <del class="strike">with</del> to the <del class="strike">loss</del> ruin of their fortune, with the relinquishment of everything quiet &amp; comfortable in life, they effected settlements in the inhospitable wilds of America; they there established civil societies <del class="strike">under</del> with various forms of constitution, but possessing all, what is inherent in all, the full &amp; perfect powers of legislation. To continue their connection with the <del class="strike">those</del> friends <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>113<span class="bracket">]</span></span> whom they had left <del class="strike">&amp; loved but</del> they arranged themselves by charters of compact under <del class="strike">the same</del> one common king <del class="strike">who became the thro&#x2019; whom</del> who thus became the link <del class="strike">uniting</del> of union between the several <del class="strike">union was ensured to them multiplied</del> parts of the empire. Some occasional assumptions of power by the parl. of Gr. Brit. however <del class="strike">foreign &amp; unknown to</del> unacknowledged by the constitution<del class="strike">s we had formed</del> of our governments were finally acquiesced in thro&#x2019; <del class="strike">the</del> warmth of affection. Proceeding thus in the fullness of mutual harmony &amp; confidence both parts of the empire encreased in population and wealth with a rapidity unknown in the history of man. The <del class="strike">various soils</del> political institutions of America, its various <del class="strike">climes</del> soils &amp; climates opening <del class="strike">sure</del> certain resource to the unfortunate &amp; to the enterprising of <del class="strike">all</del> every country<del class="strike">s where</del> and ensured to them the acquisition and <del class="strike">full</del> possession of property. Great Britain too acquired a lustre &amp; a weight <del class="strike">in the political system</del> among the powers of the <del class="strike">world</del> earth which <del class="strike">it is thought</del> her internal <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>114<span class="bracket">]</span></span> resources could never have given her. To <del class="strike">the</del> a communication of the wealth &amp; the power of <del class="strike">the several parts of the whole</del> every part of the empire we may <del class="strike">surely ascribe</del> in some measure surely ascribe the illustrious character she sustained thro&#x2019; her last European war and its successful event. At the close of that war however <del class="strike">Gr. Britain</del> having subdued all her foes she took up the unfortunate idea of subduing her friends also. Her parliament then for the first time asserted a right of unbounded legislation <del class="strike">for</del> over the colonies of America: <del class="strike">by several acts passed in the year of the 5th the 6th &amp; the 7th &amp; the 8th years of the reign of his present majesty several duties were imposed for the purpose of raising a evenue on the said colonists, the powers of courts of admiralty were extended beyond their antient and the inestimable right of being tried in all cases civil trial by twelve peers of our vicinage was taken away in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>115<span class="bracket">]</span></span> places affecting both life &amp; property. By part of an act passed in the 12th year of the present reign an American colonist charged with the offenses described in that act may be transported beyond sea for trial of such offenses by the very persons against whose pretended sovereignty the supposed offense is supposed to be committed</del> and pursuing with eagerness the newly assumed thought <del class="strike">have</del> in the space of 10 years during which they have exercisd yt right have <del class="strike">made</del> given such <del class="strike">decisive</del> severe specimens of the spirit [Editor: illegible word] this new legislation <del class="strike">would be exercised conducted [[Editor: illegible word]] towards the establishment of absolute government over us</del> as leaves no room to doubt the consequence of <del class="strike">our further</del> acquiescence under it <del class="strike">by two those two other acts passed in the 14th of his present majesty they have assumed a right of altering the form of our governments altogether, and of thereby taking away every security for the possession of life and property.</del></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_148">By several acts of parliament passed <del class="strike">in the reign of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>116<span class="bracket">]</span></span> his present majesty</del> within that <del class="strike">period</del> space of time they have <del class="strike">imposed upon us duties for the purpose of raising a revenue</del> attempted to take from us our money without our consent, they have <del class="strike">taken away the</del> interdicted all commerce <del class="strike">first of</del> of one of our principal <del class="strike">trading</del> towns thereby annihilating its property in the hands of the holders, <del class="strike">&amp; more lately</del> they have cut off <del class="strike">our</del> the commercial intercourse <del class="strike">with all of several of these</del> of whole colonies with <del class="strike">all</del> foreign countries <del class="strike">whatsoever;</del> they have extended the jurisdiction of <del class="strike">the</del> courts of admiralty beyond their antient limits thereby depriving us right of trial by jury in cases affecting both life &amp; property <del class="strike">&amp; subjecting both to the decision arbitrary decision of a single &amp; dependent judge;</del> they have declared that American subjects <del class="strike">committing</del> charged with certain <del class="strike">pretended</del> offences shall be transported beyond sea <del class="strike">fortrial</del> to be tried before the very persons against whose pretended sovereignty offenses supposed to be committed; they have attempted fundamentally to alter the form of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>117<span class="bracket">]</span></span> government in one of these colonies, a form established by acts of its own legislature and further secured <del class="strike">to them</del> by charters <del class="strike">of compact with &amp; grants from</del> on the part of the crown; they have erected <del class="strike">a tyranny</del> in a neighbouring province acquired by the joint arms of Great Britain &amp; America, a tyranny dangerous to the very existence of all these colonies. But why should we enumerate their injuries in the detail? By one act they have suspended the powers of one American legislature &amp; by another <del class="strike">they</del> have declared they may legislate for us themselves in all cases whatsoever. These two acts alone form a basis broad enough whereon to erect a despotism of unlimited extent, <del class="strike">when it is considered that the person by whom these acts are passed are not with us subject to their [[Editor: illegible word]]</del> and what is to <del class="strike">prevent</del> secure us against <del class="strike">the demolition of our present &amp; establishment of new &amp; despotie government?</del> this dreaded evil?

These temptations might put to trial the severest characters of antient virtue: with what new armour shall a British parliament <del class="strike">then</del> encounter the rude assault? Towards these deadly injuries from the tender plant of liberty which we have brought over &amp; with so much affection <del class="strike">we have planted and</del> have fostered on these our own shores we have pursued every lawful measure. We have supplicated our king at various times in terms almost disgraceful to freedom; we have reasoned, we have remonstrated with parliament in the most mild &amp; decent language; we have even proceeded to <del class="strike">break off our commercial intercourse with them altogether as to the last peaceable admonition of our determination to be free by breaking of altogether our commercial intercourse with them</del> <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>119<span class="bracket">]</span></span> break off our commercial intercourse with <del class="strike">them</del> our fellow subjects as the last peaceable admonition that our attachment to no nation on earth should supplant our attachment to liberty: and here we had well hoped was the ultimate step of the controversy. But subsequent events have shewn how vain was even this last remain of confidence in the moderation of the British ministry. During the course of the <del class="strike">last</del> year <del class="strike">they</del> their troops in a hostile manner invested the town of Boston in the province of Massachusetts bay, from that time have held the same beleaguered by sea &amp; land. On the 19th day of April last in the present year they made an unprovoked attack assault on the inhabitants of the sd province at the town of Lexington, <del class="strike">killed,</del> murdered eight of them on the spot and wounded many others. From thence they proceeded in <del class="strike">the same warlike</del> all the array <del class="strike">manner</del> of war to the town of Concord where they <del class="strike">attacked</del> set upon another party of the inhabitants of the <del class="strike">sd</del> same <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>120<span class="bracket">]</span></span> province killing many of them also burning their houses &amp; laying waste <del class="strike">their</del> property <del class="strike">&amp; continuing these depredations</del> until repressed by the arms of the people assembled to oppose this <del class="strike">hostile unprovoked</del> cruel [<del class="strike">[Editor: illegible word]</del>] aggression <del class="strike">on their lives &amp; properties.</del> Hostilities being thus commenced on the part of the <del class="strike">British</del> Ministerial <del class="strike">troops</del> army <del class="strike">they</del> have been since <del class="strike">without respite</del> by them pursued <del class="strike">the same by their</del> without regard to faith or to fame. The inhabitants of the <del class="strike">said</del> town of Boston having entered into treaty with a certain Thomas Gage <del class="strike">said to be commander of these troops and who has actually been a principal actor in the siege of the town of Boston, proffered to the inhabitants of the sd town a liberty to depart from the same on</del> principal &amp; encourager of these <del class="strike">in chief of adverse enormities violence</del> enormities it was stipulated that the sd inhabitants having first deposited <del class="strike">their arms and [[Editor: illegible word]]</del> with their own <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>121<span class="bracket">]</span></span> magistrates their arms &amp; military stores should have free liberty to depart <del class="strike">out of the same from</del> out of the sd town taking with them their other goods and other effects. Their arms &amp; military stores <del class="strike">were</del> they accordingly delivered <del class="strike">into their magistrates,</del> &amp; claimed the stipulated license of departing with their effects.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_150">A Declaration <del class="strike">of</del> by</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_151"><del class="strike">We</del> the representatives of the United colonies of America now sitting in General Congress, <del class="strike">to all nations send greeting of</del> setting forth the causes &amp; necessity of their taking up arms.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_152">The large strides of late taken by the <span class="ital">legislature of Great Britain</span> towards establishing over these colonies their absolute rule, and the hardiness of the present attempt to effect by force of arms what by law or right they could never effect, <span class="ital">render</span> it necessary for us also to change the ground of opposition, and to close with their last appeal from reason to arms. And it behooves those, who <span class="ital">are called to this great decision,</span> to be assured that their cause is approved before supreme reason; so is it of great avail that its justice be made known to the world, whose affections will ever take part with those encountering oppression. Our forefathers, inhabitants of the island of Great Britain, <del class="strike">having long endeavored to bear up against the evils of misrule,</del> left their native lan<del class="strike">d</del>s to seek on these shores a residence for civil &amp; religious freedom. At the expense of their blood, <del class="strike">with</del> to the ruin of their fortunes, with the relinquishment of everything quiet &amp; comfortable in life, they effected settlements in the inhospitable wilds of America; <del class="strike">they</del> and there established civil societies with various forms of constitution. <del class="strike">But possessing all, what is inherent in all, the full and perfect powers of legislation.</del> To continue their connection with the friends whom they had left, they arranged themselves by charters of compact under <del class="strike">one</del> the same common king, who thus completed their powers of full and perfect legislation and became the link of union between the several parts of the empire. Some occasional assumptions of power by the parliament of Great Britain, however unacknowledged by the constitution of our governments, were finally acquiesced in thro&#x2019; warmth of affection. Proceeding thus in the fullness of mutual harmony and confidence, both parts of the empire increased in population &amp; wealth with a rapidity unknown in the history of man. The political institutions of America, its various soils and climates opened a certain resource to the unfortunate &amp; to the enterprising of every country, and ensured to them the acquisition &amp; free possession of property. Great Britain too acquired a lustre and a weight among the powers of the earth which her internal resources could never have given her. To a communication of the wealth and power of <del class="strike">the whole</del> every part of the empire we may surely ascribe in some measure the illustrious character she sustained through her last European war, &amp; its successful event. At the close of that war <del class="strike">however having subdued all her foes</del><a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_064" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_064_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> it pleased our sovereign to make a change in his counsels. The new ministry finding all the foes of Britain subdued <del class="strike">she</del> took up the unfortunate idea of subduing her friends also.

By several acts of parliament passed within that <del class="strike">space of</del> time they have <del class="strike">attempted to take from us</del> undertaken to give and grant our money without our consent: a right of which we have ever had the exclusive exercise: they have interdicted all commerce to one of our principal towns, thereby annihilating its property in the hands of the holders; they have cut off the commercial intercourse of whole colonies with foreign countries; they have extended the jurisdiction of courts of admiralty beyond their antient limits; <del class="strike">thereby</del> they have <del class="strike">depriving</del> deprived us of the inestimable <del class="strike">right</del> privilege of trial by a jury of the vicinage in cases affecting both life &amp; property; they have declared that American Subjects charged with certain offenses shall be transported beyond sea to be tried before the very persons against whose pretended sovereignty the offense is supposed to be committed; they have attempted fundamentally to alter the form of government in one of these colonies, a form <del class="strike">established</del> secured by charters on the part of the crown and confirmed by acts of its own legislature; <del class="strike">and further secured by charters on the part of the crown;</del> they have erected in a neighboring province acquired by the joint arms of Great Britain &amp; America, a tyranny dangerous to the very existence of all these colonies. But why should we enumerate their injuries in the detail? By one act they have suspended the powers of one American legislature, &amp; by another have declared they may legislate for us themselves in all cases whatsoever. These two acts alone form a basis broad enough whereon to erect a despotism of unlimited extent. And what is to secure us against this dreaded evil? The persons assuming these powers are not chosen by us, are not subject to our controul or influence, are exempted by their situation from the operation of these laws, and lighten their own burthens in proportion as they increase ours. These temptations might put to trial the severest characters of antient virtue: with what new armour then shall a British parliament encounter the rude assault? towards these deadly injuries from the tender plant of liberty which we have brought over, &amp; with so much affection fostered on these our own shores, we have pursued every temperate, every respectful measure. We have supplicated our king at various times, in terms almost disgraceful to freedom; we have reasoned, we have remonstrated with parliament in the most mild &amp; decent language; we have even proceeded to break off our commercial intercourse with our fellow subjects, as the last peaceful admonition that our attachment to no nation on earth should supplant our attachment to liberty. And here we had well hoped was the ultimate step of the controversy. But subsequent events have shewn how vain was even this last remain of confidence in the moderation of the British ministry.<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_067" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_067_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> During the course of the last year their troops in a hostile manner invested the town of Boston in the province of Massachusetts bay, and from that time have held the same beleaguered by sea &amp; land. On the 19th day of April in the present year they made an unprovoked <del class="strike">attack</del> assault on the inhabitants of the said province at the town of Lexington, murdered eight of them on the spot and wounded many others. From thence they proceeded in <del class="strike">the</del> all the array of war to the town of Concord, where they set upon another party of the inhabitants of the same province, killing many of them also, burning houses, &amp; laying waste property, until repressed <del class="strike">by the arms</del><a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_068" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_068_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> the people<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_069" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_069_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> suddenly assembled to oppose this cruel aggression. Hostilities thus commenced on the part of the ministerial army have been since by them pursued without regard to faith or to fame. The inhabitants of the town of Boston in order to procure their enlargement having entered into treaty with <del class="strike">a certain Thomas Gage</del> General Gage their Governor <del class="strike">principal instigator of these enormities</del><a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_070" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_070_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> it was stipulated that the said inhabitants,<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_071" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_071_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> having first deposited their arms with their own magistrates <del class="strike">their arms &amp; military stores</del> should have liberty to depart from out of the said town taking with them their other <del class="strike">goods &amp;</del> effects. Their arms <del class="strike">and military stores</del> they accordingly delivered in, and claimed the stipulated license of departing with their effects. But in open violation of plighted faith &amp; honour, in defiance of the sacred obligations of treaty which even savage nations observe, their arms <del class="strike">and warlike stores,</del> deposited with their own magistrates to be preserved as their property, were immediately seized by a body of armed men under orders from the said <del class="strike">Thomas Gage</del> General, the greater part of the inhabitants were detained in the town, and the few permitted to depart were compelled to leave their most valuable effects behind. We leave the world to <del class="strike">their own</del> its own reflections on this atrocious perfidy. That we might no longer doubt the ultimate aim of these ministerial maneuvers <del class="strike">the same Thomas</del> General Gage, by proclamation bearing date the 12th day of June, after reciting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to declare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels &amp; traitors, to supersede <del class="strike">by his own authority</del> the exercise of the common law of the said province, and to proclaim and order instead thereof the use and exercise of the law martial. This bloody edict issued, he has proceeded to commit further ravages &amp; murders in the same province, burning the town of Charlestown, attacking &amp; killing great numbers of the people residing or assembled therein; and is now going on in an avowed course of murder &amp; devastation, taking every occasion to destroy the lives &amp; properties of the inhabitants <del class="strike">of the said province.</del> To oppose his arms we also have taken up arms. We should be wanting to ourselves, we should be perfidious to posterity, we should be unworthy that free ancestry from <del class="strike">whom</del> which we derive our descent, should we submit with folded arms to military butchery &amp; depredation, to gratify the lordly ambition, or sate the avarice of a British ministry. We do then most solemnly, before God and the world declare that, regardless of every consequence, at the risk of every distress, the arms we have been compelled to assume we will <del class="strike">wage</del> use with the perseverance, exerting to their utmost energies all those powers which our creator hath given us, to <del class="strike">guard</del> preserve that liberty which he committed to us in sacred deposit &amp; to protect from every hostile hand our<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_072" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_072_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> lives &amp; our properties. But that this our declaration may not disquiet the minds of our good fellow subjects<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_073" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_073_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> in any parts of the empire, we do further assure them that we mean not in any wise to affect that union with them in which we have so long &amp; so happily lived and which we wish so much to see again restored. That necessity must be hard indeed which may force upon us that desperate measure, or induce us to avail ourselves of any aid which their enemies might proffer. We did not embody a soldiery to commit aggression on them; we did not raise armies for glory or for conquest; we did not invade their island carrying death or slavery to its inhabitants. <del class="strike">We took up arms</del> in defence of our persons and properties under actual violation, we took up arms <del class="strike">we have taken up arms</del> when that violence shall be removed, when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors, hostilities shall cease on our part also. <del class="strike">The moment they withdraw their armies, we will disband ours.</del> For the atchievement of this happy event, we call for &amp; confide in the good offices of our fellow subjects beyond the Atlantic. Of their friendly dispositions we do not cease to hope; aware, as they must be, that they have nothing more to expect from the same common enemy, than the humble favour of being last devoured. And we devoutly implore assistance of Almighty God to conduct us happily thro&#x2019; this great conflict, to dispose <del class="strike">the minds of</del> his majesty, his ministers, &amp; parliament to <del class="strike">reasonable terms</del> reconciliation with us on reasonable terms, &amp; to deliver us from the evils of a civil war.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_158">That the colonies of America possess <del class="strike">an</del> the exclusive <del class="strike">right</del> privilege of giving &amp; granting their own money; that this involves the right of deliberating whether they will <del class="strike">give any sums</del> make any gift, for what purposes <del class="strike">they will give them</del> it shall be made, and what shall be <del class="strike">it&#x2019;s</del> the amount of the gift, and that it is a high breach of this privilege for any body of men, extraneous to their constitutions, to prescribe the purposes for which money shall be levied on them, <del class="strike">&amp;</del> to take to themselves the authority of judging <del class="strike">what shall be a sufficient levy</del> of their conditions circumstances, &amp; and situation, <del class="strike">&amp;</del> of determining the <del class="strike">sufficiency or insufficiency of any the levy proposed</del> amount of the contribution to be levied.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_160">That this privilege of giving or withholding our monies is an important barrier against <del class="strike">in</del> the undue exertion of prerogative, which if left altogether without controul <del class="strike">might</del> may be exercised to our great oppression; <del class="strike">&amp; that is also</del> &amp; all history shows <del class="strike">it</del> how efficacious its intercession for redress of grievances &amp; reestablishment of rights and how improvident would be the surrender of so powerful a mediator.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_161">We are <del class="strike">further</del> of opinion</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_163">That the suspension of the exercise of their pretended power <del class="strike">to tax levy taxes</del> of taxation being expressly made commensurate with the <del class="strike">duration</del> continuing of our gifts, <del class="strike">in order</del> these must be perpetual to make that so: <del class="strike">and experience has invariably proven that to render a governing power perpetually independent it is not the best method of preserving the friendship &amp; good offices of any part of government to render it independent by vesting it with perpetual revenues and</del> whereas no experience has shewn that a gift of perpetual revenues secures a perpetual return of duty or of <del class="strike">good</del> kind dispositions. On the contrary the parliament itself <del class="strike">with a wisdom we mean worthy to imitation cautiously</del> wisely attentive to this <del class="strike">circumstance</del> observation are in the established practice of granting their own money but from year to year only.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_164"><del class="strike">We are of the opinion that even fair terms could hardly be accepted by us</del></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_165">Tho&#x2019; desirous &amp; determined to consider in the most dispassionate <del class="strike">light</del> view every advance towards reconciliation made by the British parlmt. let our brethren of Britain reflect what could have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>129<span class="bracket">]</span></span> been the sacrifice to men of free spirits had [<del class="strike"><span class="ital">il legible</span></del>] even fair terms been proffered by freemen when attended as these were with <del class="strike">the most irritating</del> circumstances of insult &amp; defiance <del class="strike">with circumstances so insultive circumstances.</del> A proposition to give our money, when accompanied with large fleets &amp; armies. Addressed to our fears rather than to our freedom. <del class="strike">Let Britons our brethren of Britain reflect</del> with what patience <del class="strike">they</del> would they have received articles of treaty from any power on earth when <del class="strike">sent by such messengers plenipotentiaries</del> borne <del class="strike">by</del> on the point of the bayonet by <del class="strike">the hands of</del> military plenipotentiaries? <del class="strike">on the point of a bayonet.</del></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_166">We think <del class="strike">that</del> the attempt <del class="strike">alike unreasonable &amp;</del> unnecessary &amp; unwarrantable to raise upon us by force or by threats our proportional contributions to the common defense, when all know, and themselves acknowledg<del class="strike">ed</del> we have <del class="strike">ever freely &amp;</del> fully <del class="strike">given those</del> contribut<del class="strike">ions</del>ed whenever called <del class="strike">upon</del> to contribute in the character freemen <del class="strike">should be is one among a plain proof, among many others that not the obtaining these but the rendering to their absolute dominion was not the ultimate end of Parliamentary object of parliament.</del></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_167">We are of opinion it is not just yt the colonies should <del class="strike">make any</del> be required to oblige themselves <del class="strike">stipulate</del> to other contributions while Great Britain possesses a monopoly of their trade. This <del class="strike">is of</del> does of itself lay them under <del class="strike">a</del> heavy contribution levied on them.

But while the restrictions on our trade shut <del class="strike">up</del> to us the resources of wealth <del class="strike">we cannot bear it</del> is it <del class="strike">un</del>just we should <del class="strike">be expected to</del> bear all other burthens equally with those to whom <del class="strike">under no restriction have</del> every resource is open?</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_168">We conceive that the Brit. parl. has no right to intermeddle with our provisions for the support of civil governmt or administration of justice. That the provisions <del class="strike">has been made in such manner as to we have already</del> we have made are such as please ourselves, they answer the substantial purposes governmt &amp; of justice, &amp; other purposes than these should not be answered.

But while parliament pursue <del class="strike">their unmolested</del> their plan of civil govnt within their own jurisdiction we hope also to pursue ours <del class="strike">also</del> without molestation.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_169">We are of opinion the proposition is altogether unsatisfactory, because <del class="strike">the parliament</del> it imports only a suspension, not a renunciation of the right to tax us; because too it <del class="strike">is</del> does not proposed to repeal the several acts of parl, passed for the purposes <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>131<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of restraining the trade and altering the form of government of the Eastern colonies; extending the boundaries, &amp; changing the government &amp; religion of Quebec; enlarging the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty &amp; vice admiralty; taking from us the rights of trial by jury of the vicinage in cases affecting both life and property; <del class="strike">exempting the murderers of colonists from legal trial</del> transporting us into other countries to be tried for criminal offenses; exempting by mock-trial the murderers of colonists from punishment; and for quartering soldiers upon us in times of profound peace. Nor do they renounce the power of suspending our own legislatures &amp; of legislating for us themselves in all cases whatsoever. <del class="strike">So far indeed from repealing the injurious acts of parl. before mentioned they pass others at the same time equally injurious</del> On the contrary to show they mean not <del class="strike">to dis continue</del> discontinuance of <del class="strike">injuries</del> injury <del class="strike">at the very time of making this proposition</del> they <del class="strike">are</del> pass<del class="strike">ing</del> acts at the very time of <del class="strike">making</del> holding out this proposition, for restraining the commerce &amp; fisheries of the province of New England &amp; for interdicting <del class="strike">in general</del> the trade of the other colonies with all foreign nations.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_170">Upon the whole</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_171">This proposition seems to have been held up to the world to deceive <del class="strike">them</del> it into a belief that <del class="strike">the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>132<span class="bracket">]</span></span> colonies are unreasonable</del> there was no matter &amp;c.<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_076" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_076_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> <del class="strike">but</del> and more particularly to lull into fatal security our well affected fellow subjects on that other side the water <del class="strike">into a fatal security</del> till time should be given for the operation of those arms which a British minister pronounced would instantaneously reduce the &#x201C;<span class="ital">cowardly</span>&#x201D; sons of America to unreserved submission.

<div class="salute csc">Dear Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_172">&#x2014;I am sorry the situation of our country should render it not eligible to you to remain longer in it. I hope the returning wisdom of Great Britain will, ere long, put an end to this unnatural contest. There may be people to whose tempers and dispositions contention is pleasing, and who, therefore, wish a continuance of confusion, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>134<span class="bracket">]</span></span> but to me it is of all states but one, the most horrid. My first wish is a restoration of our just rights; my second, a return of the happy period, when, consistently with duty, I may withdraw myself totally from the public stage, and pass the rest of my days in domestic ease and tranquillity, banishing every desire of ever hearing what passes in the world. Perhaps (for the latter adds considerably to the warmth of the former wish), looking with fondness towards a reconciliation with Great Britain, I cannot help hoping you may be able to contribute towards expediting this good work. I think it must be evident to yourself, that the Ministry have been deceived by their officers on this side of the water, who (for what purpose I cannot tell) have constantly represented the American opposition as that of a small fraction, in which the body of the people took little part. This, you can inform them, of your own knowledge, is untrue. They have taken it into their heads, too, that we are cowards, and shall surrender at discretion to an armed force. The past and future operations of the war must confirm or undeceive them on that head. I wish they were thoroughly and minutely acquainted with every circumstance relative to America, as it exists in truth. I am persuaded, this would go far towards disposing them to reconciliation. Even those in Parliament who are called friends to America, seem to know nothing of our real determinations. I observe, they pronounced in the last Parliament, that the Congress <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>135<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of 1774 did not mean to insist rigorously on the terms they held out, but kept something in reserve, to give up; and, in fact, that they would give up everything but the article of taxation. Now, the truth is far from this, as I can affirm, and put my honor to the assertion. Their continuance in this error may, perhaps, produce very ill consequences The Congress stated the lowest terms they thought possible to be accepted, in order to convince the world they were not unreasonable. They gave up the monopoly and regulation of trade, and all acts of Parliament prior to 1764, leaving to British generosity to render these, at some future time, as easy to America as the interests of Britain would admit. But this was before blood was spilt. I cannot affirm, but have reason to think, these terms would not now be accepted. I wish no false sense of honor, no ignorance of our real intentions, no vain hope that partial concessions of right will be accepted, may induce the Ministry to trifle with accommodation, till it shall be out of their power ever to accommodate. If, indeed, Great Britain, disjointed from her colonies, be a match for the most potent nations of Europe, with the colonies thrown into their scale, they may go on securely. But if they are not assured of this, it would be certainly unwise, by trying the event of another campaign, to risk our accepting a foreign aid, which, perhaps, may not be attainable, but on condition of everlasting avulsion from Great Britain. This would be thought a hard condition, to those who still wish for re-union <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>136<span class="bracket">]</span></span> with their parent country. I am sincerely one of those, and would rather be in dependence on Great Britain, properly limited, than on any other nation on earth, or than on no nation. But I am one of those, too, who, rather than submit to the rights of legislating for us, assumed by the British Parliament, and which late experience has shown they will so cruelly exercise, would lend my hand to sink the whole Island in the ocean.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_173">If undeceiving the Minister, as to matters of fact, may change his disposition, it will, perhaps, be in your power, by assisting to do this, to render service to the whole empire, at the most critical time, certainly, that it has ever seen. Whether Britain shall continue the head of the greatest empire on earth, or shall return to her original station in the political scale of Europe, depends, perhaps, on the resolutions of the succeeding winter. God send they may be wise and salutary for us all. I shall be glad to hear from you as often as you may be disposed to think of things here. You may be at liberty, I expect, to communicate some things, consistently with your honor, and the duties you will owe to a protecting nation. Such a communication among individuals, may be mutually beneficial to the contending parties. On this or any future occasion, if I affirm to you any facts, your knowledge of me will enable you to decide on their credibility; if I hazard opinions on the dispositions of men or other speculative points, you can only know they are my opinions. My best wishes for your felicity, attend you, wherever you <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>137<span class="bracket">]</span></span> go, and believe me to be assuredly, Your friend and servant.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_174">&#x2014;I wrote to Patty [Mrs. Jefferson] on my arrival here, and there being nothing new in the political way, I enclosed her letter under a blank cover to you. Since that we have received from England news of much importance which coming through many channels we believe may be confidently relied on. Both the ministerial and provincial accounts of the battle of Bunker&#x2019;s Hill had got to England. The ministry were determined to push the war with vigor, a measure in which they were fixed by the defeat of the Spaniards by the Moors. Ninety brass cannon were embarked from the tower, and may be hourly expected either at N. York or Boston. Two thousand troops were to sail from Ireland about the 25th Sept.; these we have reason to believe are destined for N. York. Commodore Shuldam was to sail about the same time with a great number of frigates and small vessels of war, to be distributed among the middle colonies. He comes at the express and earnest intercessions of Ld. Dunmore, and the plan is to lay waste all the plantations on our river sides. Of this we give immediate notice to our Committee of Safety by an express whom we dispatched last Friday, that if any defence could be <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>138<span class="bracket">]</span></span> provided on the rivers by fortifications or small vessels it might be done immediately. In the spring, 10,000 men more are to come over. They are to be procured by taking away two-thirds of the garrison at Gibraltar (who are to be replaced by some Hessians) by 2,000 Highlanders and 5,000 Roman Catholics, whom they propose to raise in Ireland. Instead of Roman Catholics, however, some of our accounts say foreigners are to be sent. Their plan is this. They are to take possession of New York and Albany, keeping up a communication between them by means of their vessels. Between Albany and St. John&#x2019;s, they propose also to keep open the communication, and again between St. John&#x2019;s and Quebec, and Boston. By this means they expect Gage, Tryon, and Carleton may distress us on every side, acting in concert with one another. By means of Hudson&#x2019;s River, they expect to cut off all correspondence between the northern and southern rivers. Gage was appointed Governor-General of all America; but Sir Jeffrey Amherst consented afterwards to come over, so that Gage is to be recalled; but it is believed Amherst will not come till the spring; in the meantime Howe will have the command. The co&#xF6;peration of the Canadians is taken for granted in all the ministerial schemes. We hope, therefore, they will be dislocated by the events in that quarter. For an account of these I must refer you to Patty. My warmest affections attend Mrs. Eppes. Adieu.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_175">&#x2014;Since my last, we have nothing new from England or from the camps at either Cambridge or St. John&#x2019;s. Our eyes are turned to the latter place with no little anxiety, the weather having been uncommonly bad for troops in that quarter, exposed to the inclemencies of the sky without any protection. Carleton is retired to Quebec, and though it does not appear he has any intimation of Arnold&#x2019;s expedition, yet we hear he has embodied 1,100 men to be on his guard. A small vessel was the other day cast away on the Jersey shore (she was one of the transports which had some time ago brought over troops to Boston) on board of which were a captain, with his subordinate officers and marines, amounting to 23 in all, and also a Duncan Campbell who was going to recruit men at New York for General Gage, he having some time before undertaken the same business in the same place, and actually carried off 60 men. The marines and their officers were all taken immediately, except their captain and the recruiting gentleman; these pushed off in a little boat, and coasted it to Long Island, where they got on board a sloop which was to have sailed in an hour, when the party sent after them came upon them. They were brought to this city this morning, the marines having been here some time. Our good old speaker died the night before last. For the particulars of that melancholy event I must <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>140<span class="bracket">]</span></span> refer you to Patty.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_176">&#x2014;We have nothing new from England or the camp before Boston. By a private letter this day to a gentleman of Congress from General Montgomery we learn that our forces before St. John&#x2019;s are 4,000 in number besides 500 Canadians, the latter of whom have repelled with great intrepidity three different attacks from the fort. We apprehend it will not hold out much longer as Monsr. St. Luc de la Corne and several other principal inhabitants of Montreal who have been our great enemies have offered to make terms. This St. Luc is a great Seigneur amongst the Canadians and almost absolute with the Indians, he has been our most bitter enemy, he is acknowledged to be the greatest of all scoundrels, to be assured of this I need only to mention to you that he is the ruffian who when during the late war Fort William Henry was surrendered to the French &amp; Indians on condition of saving the lives of the garrison had every soul murdered in cold blood. The check which the Canadians received at first is now wearing off. They were made to believe we had an army of 15,000 men going there, but when they saw Montgomery with but 2,700 they were thunderstruck at the situation they had brought themselves into. However when they saw even this <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>141<span class="bracket">]</span></span> small armament march boldly to invest St. John&#x2019;s &amp; put a good face on the matter they revived, &amp; the recruits since have contributed to inspirit them more.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_177">I have set apart nearly one day in every week since I came here to write letters. Notwithstanding this I never had received the scrip of a pen from any mortal breathing. I should have excepted two lines from Mr. Pendleton to desire me to buy him 24 lb of wire from which I concluded he was alive. I speak not this for you from whom I would not wish to receive a letter till I know you can write one without injury to your health, but in future as I must be satisfied with information from my colleagues that my county still exists, so I am determined to be satisfied also with their epistolary communications of what passes within our knowledge.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_181">&#x2014;I am to give you the melancholy intelligence of the death of our most worthy Speaker, which happened here on the 22d of the last month. He was struck with an apoplexy, and expired within five hours.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_182">I have it in my power to acquaint you, that the success of our arms has corresponded with the justice of our cause. Chambly and St. John&#x2019;s were taken some weeks ago, and in them the whole regular army in Canada, except about forty or fifty men. This day, certain intelligence has reached us, that our General, Montgomery, is received into Montreal; and we expect, every hour, to be informed that Quebec has opened its arms to Colonel Arnold, who, with eleven hundred men, was sent from Boston up the Kennebec, and down the Chaudi&#xE8;re river to that place. He expected to be there early this month. Montreal acceded to us on the 13th, and Carlton set out, with <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>144<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the shattered remains of his little army, for Quebec, where we hope he will be taken up by Arnold. In a short time, we have reason to hope, the delegates of Canada will join us in Congress, and complete the American union, as far as we wish to have it completed. We hear that one of the British transports has arrived at Boston; the rest are beating off the coast, in very bad weather. You will have heard, before this reaches you, that Lord Dunmore has commenced hostilities in Virginia. That people bore with everything, till he attempted to burn the town of Hampton. They opposed and repelled him, with considerable loss on his side, and none on ours. It has raised our countrymen into a perfect phrensy. It is an immense misfortune, to the whole empire, to have a King of such a disposition at such a time. We are told, and everything proves it true, that he is the bitterest enemy we have. His Minister is able, and that satisfies me that ignorance or wickedness, somewhere, controls him. In an earlier part of this contest, our petitions told him, that from our King there was but one appeal. The admonition was despised, and that appeal forced on us. To undo his empire, he has but one truth more to learn; that, after colonies have drawn the sword, there is but one step more they can take. That step is now pressed upon us, by the measures adopted, as if they were afraid we would not take it. Believe me, dear Sir, there is not in the British empire a man who more cordially loves a union with Great Britain, than I do. But by the God that made me, I will cease to exist before I yield to a connection on such terms as the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>145<span class="bracket">]</span></span> British Parliament propose; and in this, I think I speak the sentiments of America. We want neither inducement nor power, to declare and assert a separation. It is will, alone, which is wanting, and that is growing apace under the fostering hand of our King. One bloody campaign will probably decide, everlastingly, our future course; and I am sorry to find a bloody campaign is decided on. If our winds and waters should not combine to rescue their shores from slavery, and General Howe&#x2019;s reinforcements should arrive in safety, we have hopes he will be inspirited to come out of Boston and take another drubbing; and we must drub him soundly, before the sceptred tyrant will know we are not mere brutes, to crouch under his hand, and kiss the rod with which he designs to scourge us,</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_184">A Declaration (or a letter to Howe) on Allen&#x2019;s case.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_185">When necessity compelled us to take up arms against Great Britain in defence of our just rights, we thought it a circumstance of <del class="strike">some</del> comfort that our enemy was brave and civilized. It is the happiness of modern times that the evils of necessary war are softened by the refinement of manners &amp; sentiment and that an enemy is an object of vengeance, in <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>146<span class="bracket">]</span></span> arms, &amp; in the field only. It is with pain we hear that Mr. Allen and <del class="strike">eleven</del> others taken with him while fighting bravely in their country&#x2019;s cause, are sent to Britain in irons, to be punished for pretended treason; treasons too created by one of those very laws whose obligation we deny, and mean to contest by the sword.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_186">De rebus novis, ita est. One of our armed vessels has taken an English store ship coming with all the implements of war (except powder) to Boston. She is worth about &#xA3;30,000 sterling as General Washington informs us, &amp; the stores are adapted to his wants as perfectly as if he had sent the invoice. They have also taken two small provision vessels from Ireland <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>148<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to Boston. A forty gun ship blew up the other day by accident in the harbor of Boston. Of a certainty the hand of God is upon them. Our last intelligence from Arnold to be relied on is by letter from him. He was then at Point Levy opposite Quebec &amp; had a great number of canoes ready to cross the river. The Canadians received him with cordiality &amp; the regular force in Quebec was too inconsiderable to give him any inquietude. A later report makes him in possession of Quebec, but this is not authenticated. Montgomery had proceeded in quest of Carleton &amp; his small fleet of 11 pickeroons, then on Lake St. Francis. He had got below him &amp; had batteries so planted as to prevent his passing. It is thought he cannot escape their vigilance. I hope Ld. Chatham may live till the fortune of war puts his son into our hands, &amp; enables us by returning him safe to his father, to pay a debt of gratitude. I wish you would get into Convention &amp; come here. Think of it. Accomplish it. Adieu.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_187">The Congress have promoted Brigadier Genl. Montgomery to be a Major General, and on being assured that Arnold is in possession of Quebec it is probable he will be made a Brigadier General, one of those offices being vacant by Montgomery&#x2019;s promotion. This march of Arnold&#x2019;s is equal to Xenophon&#x2019;s retreat. Be so good as to enquire for the box of books you lodged for me at Nelson&#x2019;s &amp; get them to a place of safety. Perhaps some oppty may offer of sending it to Richmond.</p>

<div class="salute csc">Dear Nelson,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_212">&#x2014;I arrived here last Tuesday after being detained hence six weeks longer than I intended by a malady of which Gilmer can inform you. I have nothing new to inform you of as the last post carried you an account of the naval engagement in Delaware. I inclose a vote of yesterday <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>152<span class="bracket">]</span></span> on the subject of government as the ensuing campaign is likely to require greater exertion than our unorganized powers may at present effect. Should our Convention propose to establish now a form of government perhaps it might be agreeable to recall for a short time their delegates. It is a work of the most interesting nature and such as every individual would wish to have his voice in. In truth it is the whole object of the present controversy; for should a bad government be instituted for us in future it had been as well to have accepted at first the bad one offered to us from beyond the water without the risk &amp; expence of contest. But this I mention to you in confidence, as in our situation, a hint to any other is too delicate however anxiously interesting the subject is to our feelings. In future you shall hear from me weekly while you stay, and I shall be glad to receive Conventional as well as publick intelligence from you.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_213">P. S.&#x2014;In the other colonies who have instituted government they recalled their delegates, leaving only one or two to give information to Congress of matters which might relate to their country particularly, and giving them a vote during the interval of absence.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_214">I am at present in our old lodgings tho&#x2019; I think, as the excessive heats of the city are coming on fast, to endeavor to get lodgings in the skirts of the town where I may have the benefit of a freely circulating air. Tell Page &amp; McClurgh that I received their letters this morning and shall devote myself to their contents. I am here in the same uneasy anxious <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>153<span class="bracket">]</span></span> state in which I was the last fall without Mrs. Jefferson who could not come with me. I wish much to see you here, yet hope you will contrive to bring on as early as you can in convention the great questions of the session. I suppose they will tell us what to say on the subject of independence,<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_091" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_091_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> but hope respect will be expressed to the right of opinion in other colonies who may happen to differ from them. When at home I took great pains to enquire into the sentiments of the people on that head, in the upper counties I think I may safely say nine out of ten are for it. Adieu. My compliments to Mrs. Nelson.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_215">May 19. Yesterday we received the disagreeable news of a second defeat at Quebec. Two men of war, two frigates and a tender arrived there early on the 6th instant. About 11 o&#x2019;clock the same day the enemy sallied out to the number of a thousand. Our forces were so dispersed at different posts that not more than 200 could be collected at Headquarter&#x2019;s. This small force could not resist the enemy. All our cannon, 500 muskets &amp; 200 sick men fell into their hands. Besides this one of their frigates got possession of a batteau with 30 barrels of powder &amp; an armed vessel which our crew was forced to abandon. Our army was to retreat to the mouth of the Sorel.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_216">Genl. Arnold was to set off from Montreal to join them immediately, upon whose rejoining them, it was hoped they might return as far as Dechambeau. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>154<span class="bracket">]</span></span> General Wooster has the credit of this misadventure, and if he cannot give a better account of it than has yet been heard, I hope he will be made an example of. Generals Thomas and Sullivan were on their way with reinforcements. Arnold had gone up to Montreal on business, or as some say, disgusted by Wooster.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_217">The congress having ordered a new battalion of riflemen to be raised in Virginia, Innis wishes much to be translated to it from the Eastern shore which was so disagreeable to him that he had determined to have resigned.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_407">The Committee to whom were re-committed the Cartel between Brigadier General Arnold &amp; captain Forster for the exchange of prisoners &amp; the several papers relating thereto have had the same under <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>184<span class="bracket">]</span></span> their consideration and agreed to the following report.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_408">Your committee having proceeded to make enquiry into the facts relating to the agreement entered into at St. Anne&#x2019;s between Brigadier General Arnold &amp; Capt. Forster, find a part of them well authenticated and others not, yet being apprehensive that silence on the part of Congress may be construed by some into a ratification of the said agreement they have thought it best to state the same as they appear at present, with such resolutions as they will justify if found true, reserving final decision till the whole truth shall be accurately enquired into &amp; transmitted to Congress.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_409">Your Committee on the best information they have been able to obtain find:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_410">That on the 24th day of May last a party of the enemy consisting as is said of about 600 men under the command of capt. Forster attacked a post at the Cedars held by a garrison of 350 Con[<span class="ital">tinental for</span>]ces, then under the command of Major Butterfield.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_411">That the said post was secured by a <span class="ital">Stoc</span>[<span class="ital">kade of wood?</span>] to cover the garrison from the enemy&#x2019;s musquetry, that there were mounted therein two field pieces, &amp; that the enemy had no cannon.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_412">That the said garrison had ammunition &amp; provisions sufficient to have lasted them ten days, that they had reason to expect <span class="ital">immediate</span> reinforcements <span class="ital">in a few days,</span><a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_176" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_176_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> which on a requisition from themselves, was actually on it&#x2019;s way from Montreal, and moreover were so near the main body of the army <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>185<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that they could not doubt being joined by detachments from thence sufficient to oblige the enemy to retire.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_413">That the enemy for two days kept up only a scattering fire, by which not a single man of the garrison was killed or wounded, &amp; that on the third day the garrison surrendered themselves prisoners of war having capitulated for the preservation of their own baggage from plunder, <span class="ital">&amp; that their persons should not be deliver&#x2019;d into the hands of the savages.</span><a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_177" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_177_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_414">That the enemy broke the capitulation utterly &amp; immediately on their part. Plundering the garrison of their baggage &amp; stripping the cloathes from their backs, <span class="ital">&amp; Delivering the Prisoners into the hands of the Savages.</span><a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_178" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_178_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_415">That they then proceeded against the reinforcement which was on it&#x2019;s way consisting of about 150 men under the command of Major Sherburne, that Major Sherburne &amp; his party engaged &amp; fought them with bravery; but being at length surrounded by numbers greatly superior and informed that the fort and garrison were already in the hands of the enemy, they were obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war also; but whether on capitulation or not your committee are not informed.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_416">That after they had put themselves into the hands of the enemy, the said enemy murdered two of them, butchering the one with tomahawks &amp; drowning the other; and left divers others exposed on an island naked and perishing with cold &amp; famine.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_417">That by this time Brigadier General Arnold who <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>186<span class="bracket">]</span></span> had been detached by Major General Thomas to relieve the fort at the Cedars, approached &amp; was making dispositions to attack the enemy.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_418">That capt. Forster, thereupon <span class="ital">notified</span><a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_179" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_179_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> General Arnold, that if he attacked him, the prisoners, then 500 in number, would every man of them be put to death; &amp; proposing at the same time an exchange of [<span class="ital">torn out.</span>]</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_419">Arnold was extremely averse to entering on any agreement of that kind, &amp; was at length induced to do it by no other motive than that of saving the prisoners from cruel &amp; inhuman death, threatened in such terms as left no doubt it was to be perpetrated.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_420">That agreement was thereupon entered into between Brigadr. Genl. Arnold &amp; capt. Forster, bearing date at St. Anne&#x2019;s, on the 27th day of May, whereby the s&#x303;d Forster stipulated that he would deliver up all the said prisoners except <span class="ital">such as were</span><a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_180" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_180_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Canadians, to Genl. Arnold; who agreed on the other part that so many of equal rank &amp; condition should be returned to the enemy of those taken by our arms on former occasions. That the prisoners so stipulated to be given up to the enemy were not in the possession of Genl. Arnold, nor under his direction but were at that time distributed through various parts of the continent under the orders of this house.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_421">That capt. Forster in violation of this agreement also detained a considerable number of the prisoners he had thus stipulated to deliver, &amp; sent them into the Indian countries for purposes unknown.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>187<span class="bracket">]</span></span>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_426">Resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that Major Sherburne &amp; his party having fought as men should do, so much of the said sponsion as relates to their exchange should be ratified &amp; confirmed by this house; &amp; that an equal number of captives from the enemy, of the same rank &amp; condition <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>188<span class="bracket">]</span></span> should be restored to them as stipulated by the said sponsion.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_427">Resolved that [<span class="ital">torn out</span>] opinion of this com. [<span class="ital">torn out</span>] the said sponsion as relates to the exchange of Major Butterfield &amp; the garrison surrendering with him, ought not to be ratified: because we should redeem none but those who will fight, and because too the said sponsion excepted the Canadian prisoners, &amp; we will in no case admit a distinction of countries among men fighting in the same cause.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_428">Resolved therefore that the said Major Butterfield &amp; garrison should still be considered as prisoners of war, appertaining to the enemy; but as by the actual murder of two of the prisoners &amp; the threats at St. Anne&#x2019;s to put the others to death, the enemy are found capable of destroying their captives, the s&#x303;d prisoners ought not to be put into their hands, but should be permitted to remain in their own country; that in the meantime they shall not bear arms nor otherwise act against the enemy, but are bound to demean themselves in all things in the manner of prisoners of war enlarged on their parole, &amp; to hold themselves subject to be recalled by the enemy whenever proper security shall have been given that their lives shall be safe.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_429">Resolved that previous to the delivery of the prisoners to be returned in lieu of majr. Sherburne &amp; those captivated with him, satisfaction be required from the enemy for the murder of the two prisoners by delivering into our hands capt. Forster, or the individuals concerned in perpetrating that horrid act; <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>189<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and likewise restitution for the plunder at the Cedars taken contrary to the faith of the capitulation; and that till such satisfaction &amp; restitution be made, the said prisoners be not delivered.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_430">Resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that if the enemy shall put to death, torture, or otherwise ill treat any of the hostages in their hands, or of the Canadian, or other prisoners captivated by them in the service of the United colonies, recourse must be had to retaliation as the sole means of stopping the progress of human butchery, &amp; that for that purpose punishments of the same kind &amp; degree be inflicted on an equal number of their subjects taken by us, till they shall be taught due respect to the violated rights of nations.</p>

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_458">&#x2014;Yours of 22d June came to hand this morning and gratified me much, as this with your former contains interesting intelligence.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_459">Our affairs in Canada go still retrograde, but I hope they are now nearly at their worst. The fatal sources of these misfortunes have been want of hard money with which to procure provisions, the ravages of the small pox with which one half of our army is still down, and an unlucky choice of some officers. By our last letters, Genl. Sullivan was retired as far as Isle au noix with his dispirited army and Burgoyne pursuing him with one of double or treble his numbers. It gives much concern that he had determined to make a stand there as it exposes to great danger of losing him and his army; and it was the universal sense of his officers that he ought to retire. Gen. Schuyler has sent him positive orders to retire to Crown point but whether they will reach him in time enough to withdraw him from danger is questionable. Here it seems to be the opinion of all the General officers that an effectual stand may be made and the enemy not only prevented access into New York, but by preserving a superiority on the lakes we may renew our attacks on them to advantage as soon as our army is recovered from the small pox and recruited. But recruits, tho long ordered, are very difficult to be procured on account of that dreadful disorder.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>198<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_460">The Conspiracy at New York is not yet thoroughly developed, nor has any thing transpired, the whole being kept secret till the whole is got through. One fact is known of necessity, that one of the General&#x2019;s lifeguards being thoroughly convicted was to be shot last Saturday. General Howe with some ships (we know not how many) is arrived at the Hook, and, as is said, has landed some horse on the Jersey shore. The famous major Rogers is in custody on violent suspicion of being concerned in the conspiracy.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_461">I am glad to hear of the Highlanders carried into Virginia. It does not appear certainly how many of these people we have but I imagine at least six or eight hundred. Each effort should be made to keep up the spirits of the people the succeeding three months; which in the Universal opinion will be the only ones in which our trial can be severe.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_462">I wish you had depended on yourself rather than others for giving me an account of the late nomination of delegates. I have no other state of it but the number of votes for each person. The omission of Harrison and Braxton and my being next to the lag give me some alarm. It is a painful situation to be 300 miles from one&#x2019;s country, and thereby opened to secret assassination without a possibility of self-defence. I am willing to hope nothing of this kind has been done in my case, but yet I cannot be easy. If any doubts has arisen as to me, my country will have my political creed in the form of a &#x201C;Declaration&#x201D; &amp;c. which I was lately directed to draw. This will give decisive proof that my own sentiment concurred with the vote they instructed <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>199<span class="bracket">]</span></span> me to give. Had the post been to go a day later we might have been at liberty to communicate this whole matter.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_463">July 2. I have kept open my letter till this morning but nothing more new. Adieu.</p>

We have warned them from Time to Time of attempts of their Legislature to extend a Jurisdiction over these our States. We have reminded them of the Circumstances of our Emigration and Settlement here, no one of which could warrant so strange a Pretension.

They too have been deaf to the Voice of Justice and of Consanguinity, and when occasions have been given them by the regular Course of their Laws of removing from their Councils, the Disturbers of our Harmony, they have by their free Election, re-established them in Power.

These Facts have given the last Stab to agonizing affection, and manly Spirit bids us to renounce forever these unfeeling Brethren. We must endeavour to forget our former Love for them, and to hold them, as we hold the rest of Mankind, enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_493">A Declaration by the Representatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in General Congress assembled.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_494">When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natture&#x2019;s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_495">We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with inherent &amp; inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their happiness. Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes: and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations begun at a distinguished period and pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to expunge their former systems of government. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of unremitting injuries and usurpations, among which appears no solitary fact to contradict the uniform tenor of the rest; but all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world, for the truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied by falsehood.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_496">He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_497">He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_498">He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation, in the legislature, a right inestimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_499">He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_500">He has dissolved Representative houses repeatedly and continually for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the right of the people:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_501">He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise, the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_502">He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states, for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither; and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_503">He has suffered the administration of justice totally to cease in some of these states, refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_504">He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_505">He has erected a multitude of new offices by a self assumed power and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_506">He has kept among us in times of peace, standing armies and ships of war without the consent of our legislatures:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_507">He has affected to render the military, independent of and superior to the civil power:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_508">He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitutions and unacknowledged by our laws, giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation, for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us; for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states; for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world; for imposing taxes on us without our consent; for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury; for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences; for abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies; for taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and fundamentally the forms of our governments for suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_509">He has abdicated government here, withdrawing his governors, and declaring us out of his allegiance and protection.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_510">He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_511">He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized nation:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_512">He has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions of existence.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_513">He has incited treasonable insurrections of our fellow-citizens, with the allurements of forfeiture and confiscation of our property:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_514">He has constrained others, taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_515">He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of distant people, who never offended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the Christian king of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market where Men should be bought and sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce: and that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished dye, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them by murdering the people upon whom he also obtruded them; thus paying off former crime committed against the liberties of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_516">In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injuries. A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a people who mean to be free. Future ages will scarce believe that the hardiness of one man adventured within the short compass of twelve years only, to build a foundation, so broad and undisguised for tyranny over a people fostered and fixed in the principles of freedom.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_517">Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time to attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over these our states.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_538">He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_547">The dignity and stability of government in all its branches, the morals of the people, and every blessing of society, depend so much upon an upright and skillful administration of justice, that the judicial power ought to be distinct from both the legislature and executive, and independent upon both, that so it may be a check upon both, as both should be checks upon that. The judges, therefore, should always be men of learning and experience in the laws, of exemplary morals, great patience, calmness and attention; their minds should not be distracted with jarring interests; they should not be dependent upon any man or body of men. To these ends they should hold estates for life in their offices, or, in other words, their commissions should be during good behavior, and their salaries ascertained and established by law.</p>

<div class="salute">Dear Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_563">&#x2014;Yours of the 3rd inst. came to day. I wish I could be better satisfied on the point of Patty&#x2019;s recovery. I had not heard from her at all for two posts before, and no letter from herself now. I wish it were in my power to return by way of the Forest, as you think it will be impracticable for Mrs. Eppes to travel to the mountains. However, it will be late in August before I can get home, and our Convention will call me down early in October. Till that time, therefore, I must defer the hope of seeing Mrs. Eppes and yourself. Admiral Howe is himself arrived at New York, and two or three vessels, supposed to be of his fleet, were coming in. The whole is expected daily.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_564">Washington&#x2019;s numbers are greatly increased, but we do not know them exactly. I imagine he must have from 30 to 35,000 by this time. The enemy the other day ordered two of their men-of-war to hoist anchor and push by our batteries up the Hudson River. Both wind and tide were very fair. They passed all the batteries with ease, and, as far as is known, without receiving material damage; though there was an incessant fire kept up on them. This experiment of theirs, I suppose, is a prelude to the passage of their whole fleet, and seems to indicate an <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>222<span class="bracket">]</span></span> intention of landing above New York. I imagine General Washington, finding he cannot prevent their going up the river, will prepare to amuse them whenever they shall go. Our army from Canada is now at Crown Point, but still one half down with the smallpox. You ask about Arnold&#x2019;s behavior at the Cedars. It was this. The scoundrel, Major Butterfield, having surrendered three hundred and ninety men, in a fort with twenty or thirty days&#x2019; provision, and ammunition enough, to about forty regulars, one hundred Canadians, and five hundred Indians, before he had lost a single man&#x2014;and Maj. Sherburne, who was coming to the relief of the fort with one hundred men, having, after bravely engaging the enemy an hour and forty minutes, killing twenty of them and losing twelve of his own, been surrounded by them, and taken prisoners also &#x2014;Gen. Arnold appeared on the opposite side of the river and prepared to attack them. His numbers I know not, but believe they were about equal to the enemy. Capt. Foster, commander of the king&#x2019;s troops, sent over a flag to him, proposing an exchange of prisoners for as many of the king&#x2019;s in our possession, and, moreover, informed Arnold that if he should attack, the Indians would put every man of the prisoners to death. Arnold refused, called a council of war, and, it being now in the night, it was determined to attack next morning. A second flag came over; he again refused, though in an excruciating situation, as he saw the enemy were in earnest about killing the prisoners. His men, too, began to be importunate for the recovery of their fellow-soldiers. A third <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>223<span class="bracket">]</span></span> flag came, the men grew more clamorous and Arnold, now almost raving with rage and compassion, was obliged to consent to the exchange and six days suspension of hostilities, Foster declaring he had not boats to deliver them in less time. However, he did deliver them so much sooner as that before the six days were expired, himself and party had fled out of all reach. Arnold then retired to Montreal. You have long before this heard of Gen. Thompson&#x2019;s defeat. The truth of that matter has never appeared till lately. You will see it in the public papers. No men on earth ever behaved better than ours did. The enemy behaved dastardly. Col. Allen (who was in the engagement) assured me this day, that such was the situation of our men, half way up to the thighs in mud for several hours, that five hundred men of spirit must have taken the whole; yet the enemy were repulsed several times, and our people had time to extricate themselves and come off. It is believed the enemy suffered considerably. The above account of Arnold&#x2019;s affair you may rely on, as I was one of a committee appointed to inquire into the whole of that matter, and have it from those who were in the whole transaction, and were taken prisoners.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_567">&#x2014;The honble the convention of Virga attending to the inconveniencies which may arise from an unsettled jurisdn in the neighborhood of fort pitt, have instructed us to propose to your honorable house to agree on some temporary boundary which may serve for preservation of the peace in that territory until an amicable and final determination may be had before arbiters mutually chosen. Such temporary settlement will from its nature do predjudice to neither party when at any future day a complete informn of facts shall enable them to submit the doubt to a just &amp; final decision. We can assure you that the colony of Virga does not entertain a wish that one inch should be added to theirs from the territory of a sister colony &amp; we have a perfect confidence that the same just sentiments prevails in your house. Parties thus disposed can scarcely meet with difficulty in adjusting either a temporary or a final settlement. The decision, whatever it be, will not annihilate the lands. They will remain to be occupied by Americans &amp; whether these be counted in the numbers of this or that of the United States will be thought a matter of little moment.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_571">A middle line is thought to be just. Braddock&#x2019;s old road crosses the Yohiogany in the Allegany mountain. Then turns along by the head of the Redstone on the West side of the Yohiogany &amp; crosses the Laurel hill about 6 miles from Stewart&#x2019;s (or Hart&#x2019;s) crossing, then crosses the river at Stewart&#x2019;s crossing, Jacob&#x2019;s creek 4 m above mouth, Swiglie<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_203" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_203_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> 5 m above mouth, then goes down to the Monongahela about 2 m below the mouth of Yohiogany then recrosses it within a mile &amp; there stopped.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_572">This would give tolerable satisfaction to Virginia, would throw about 150 Pennsylvas into Virga &amp; about 20 or 30 Virginians into Pennsylvana.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_575">We were informed a few weeks ago that 5000 <del class="strike">lb.</del> of lead imported by our colony were landed at Fredsbgh. As it appeared very unlikely it should be wanting in Virga, and the flying camp forming in the Jerseys, in the face of a powerful enemy, are likely to be in distress for this article, we thought we should be wanting to the public cause, which includes that of our own country, had we hesitated to desire it to be brought here. Had the wants of the camp admitted the delay of an application to you we should most certainly have waited an order from you, but their distress is instantaneous. Even this supply is insufficient. The army in Canada, &amp; the army in N. York will want much lead &amp; there seems to be no certain source of supply unless the mine in Virga can be rendered such. We are therefore by direction of Congress to beg further you will be pleased to send them what lead can be spared from Wmburgh, and moreover order 15 or 20 tons to be brought here immediately from the mine.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>227<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_576">We take the liberty of recommending the lead mines to you as an object of vast importance, We think it impossible they can be worked to too great an extent. Considered as perhaps the sole means of supporting the American cause, they are inestimable. As an article of commerce to our colony, too, they will be valuable; &amp; even the waggonage, if done either by the colony or individuals belonging to it, will carry to it no trifling sum of money. We enclose you a resoln of Congress of the subjects of forts &amp; garrisons on the Ohio.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_577">Several vacancies having happened in our battalions, we are unable to have them filled for want of a list of the officers stating their seniority. We must beg the favor of you to furnish us with one. We received from Colo. R. H. Lee a resolution of Convention recommending us to endeavor that the promotions of the officers be according to seniority without regard to regiments or companies. In one instance indeed the Congress reserved to themselves a right of departing from seniority; that is where a person either out of the line of command, or in an inferior part of it, has displayed eminent talents. Most of the the general officers have been promoted in this way. Without this reservation the whole continent must have been supplied with general officers from the Eastern colonies, where a large army was formed &amp; officered before any other colony had occasion to raise troops at all, &amp; a number of experienced, able &amp; valuable officers must have been lost to the public merely from the locality of their situation.</p>

We therefore take the liberty of desiring you to stop so many of the powder waggons now on their way to Wmsburgh as may be necessary &amp; return them immediately with this lead, &amp; whatever more you can collect sending the powder on by other <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>229<span class="bracket">]</span></span> waggons. But should the lead have been sent to Wmsburgh the waggons may then proceed on their Journey &amp; the Govr. to whom we have written will take care of the matter.<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_205" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_205_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

<div class="salute csc">Dear Page,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_582">&#x2014;On the receipt of your letter we enquired into the probability of getting your seal done here. We find a drawer and an engraver here both of whom we have reason to believe are excellent in their way. They did great seals for Jamaica and Barbadoes both of which are said to have been well done, and a seal for the Philosophical society here which we are told is excellent. But they are expensive, and will require two months to complete it. The drawing the figures for the engraver will cost about 50 dollars, and the engraving will be still more. Nevertheless as it would be long before we could consult you and receive an answer, as we think you have no such hands, and the expence is never to be incurred a second time we shall order it to be done. I like the device of the first side of the seal much. The second I think is too much crowded, nor is the design so striking. But for god&#x2019;s sake what is the &#x201C;<span class="ital">Deus nobis haec otia facit</span>&#x201D;<span class="ital">?</span> It puzzles every body here; if my country really enjoys that <span class="ital">otium,</span> it is singular, as every other colony seems to be hard <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>230<span class="bracket">]</span></span> struggling. I think it was agreed on before Dunmore&#x2019;s flight from Gwyn&#x2019;s island so that it can hardly be referred to the temporary <span class="ital">holiday</span> that has given you. This device is too &#xE6;nigmatical, since it puzzles now, it will be absolutely insoluble fifty years hence.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_583">I would not advise that the French gentleman should come here. We have so many of that country and have been so much imposed on, that the Congress begins to be sore on that head. Besides there is no prospect of raising horse this way. But if you approve of the Chevalier de St. Aubin, why not appoint him yourselves, as your troops of horse are Colonial not Continental.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_584">The 8th battalion will no doubt be taken into Continental pay from the date you mention. So also will be the two written for lately to come to the Jersies. The 7th should have been moved in Congress long e&#x2019;er now, but the muster roll sent us by Mr. Yates was so miserably defective that it would not have been received, and would have exposed him. We therefore desired him to send one more full, still giving it the same date, and I enclosed him a proper form. If he is diligent we may receive it by next post.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_585">The answer to your public letter we have addressed to the governor.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_586">There is nothing new here. Washington&#x2019;s and Mercer&#x2019;s camps recruit with amazing slowness. Had they been reinforced more readily something might have been attempted on Staten Island. The enemy there are not more than 8, or 10,000 strong. Ld Howe has recd. none of his fleet, unless some Highlanders <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>231<span class="bracket">]</span></span> (about 8, or 10 vessels) were of it. Our army at Tyonderoga is getting out of the small pox. We have about 150 carpenters I suppose got there by now. I hope they will out-build the enemy, so as to keep our force on the lake superior to theirs. There is a mystery in the dereliction of Crown-point. The general officers were unanimous in preferring Tyonderoga, and the Field officers against it. The latter have assigned reasons in their remonstrance which appear unanswerable, yet every one acquainted with the ground pronounce the measure right without answering these reasons.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_587">Having declined serving here the next year, I shall be with you at the first session of our assembly. I purpose to leave this place the 11th of August, having so advised Mrs. Jefferson by last post, and every letter brings me such an account of the state of her health, that it is with great pain I can stay here till then. But Braxton purposing to leave us the day after tomorrow, the colony would be unrepresented were I to go, before the 11th. I hope to see Col. Lee and Mr. Wythe here. Tho&#x2019; the stay of the latter will I hope be short, as he must not be spared from the important department of the law. Adieu, adieu.</p>

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_588">&#x2014;We have nothing new here now but from the southward. The successes there I hope <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>232<span class="bracket">]</span></span> will prove valuable here, by giving new spirit to our people. The ill successes in Canada had depressed the minds of many; when we shall hear the last of them I know not; everybody had supposed Crown Point would be a certain stand for them, but they have retreated from that to Ticonderoga, against everything which in my eye wears the shape of reason. When I wrote you last, we were deceived in General Washington&#x2019;s numbers. By a return which came to hand a day or two after, he then had but 15,000 effective men. His reinforcements have come in pretty well since. The flying camp in the Jerseys under General Mercer begins to form, but not as fast as exigencies require. The Congress have, therefore, been obliged to send for two of our battalions from Virginia. I hope that country is perfectly safe now; and if it is, it seems hardly right that she should not contribute a man to an army of 40,000 and an army too on which was to depend the decision of all our rights. Lord Howe&#x2019;s fleet has not yet arrived. The first division sailed five days before he did, but report says it was scattered by a storm. This seems probable, as Lord Howe had a long passage. The other two divisions were not sailed when he came away. I do not expect his army will be here and fit for action till the middle or last of August; in the meantime, if Mercer&#x2019;s camp could be formed with the expedition it merits, it might be possible to attack the present force from the Jersey side of Staten Island, and get rid of that beforehand; the militia go in freely, considering they leave their harvest to rot in the field.</p>

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_590">&#x2014;I am sorry to hear that the Indians have commenced war, but greatly pleased you have been so decisive on that head. Nothing will reduce those wretches so soon as pushing the war into the heart of their country. But I would not stop there. I would never cease pursuing them while one of them remained on this side the Mississippi. So unprovoked an attack &amp; so treacherous a one should never be forgiven while one of them remains near enough to do us injury. The Congress having had reason to suspect the Six nations intended war, instructed their commissioners to declare to them peremptorily that if they chose to go to war with us, they should be at liberty to remove their families out of our settlements, but to remember that they should not only never more return to their dwellings on any terms but that we would never cease pursuing them with war while one remained on the face of the earth; &amp; moreover, to avoid equivocation, to let them know they must recall their young men from <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>234<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Canada, or we should consider them as acting against us nationally. This decisive declaration produced an equally decisive act on their part; they have recalled their young men, &amp; are stirring themselves with anxiety to keep their people quiet, so that the storm we apprehended to be brewing there it is hoped is blown over. Colo. Lee being unable to attend here till the 20th inst I am under the painful necessity of putting off my departure, notwithstanding the unfavorable situation of Mrs Jefferson&#x2019;s health. We have had hopes till to-day of receiving an authentication of the next year&#x2019;s delegation, but are disappointed. I know not who should have sent it, the Governor, or President of Convention: but certainly somebody should have done it. What will be the consequence I know not. We cannot be admitted to take our seat on any precedent or the spirit of any precedent yet set! According to the standing rules not only an authentic copy will be required, but it must be entered in the journals verbatim that it may there appear we have right to sit. This seems the more necessary as the quorum is then to be reduced. Some of the newspapers indeed mention that on such a day such &amp; such gentlemen were appointed to serve for the next year, but could newspaper evidence be received. They could not furnish the form of the appointment, not yet that quorum is to be admitted.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_591">Ld. Howe is recruiting fast. Forty odd ships arrived the other day, &amp; others at other times. It is questionable whether our recruits come in so speedily as his. Several valuable West Indian men have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>235<span class="bracket">]</span></span> been taken &amp; brought in lately, &amp; the spirit of privateering is gaining ground fast. No news from Ticonderoga. I enclose you (to amuse your curiosity) the form of the prayer substituted in the room of the prayer for the King by Mr. Duch&#xE9;, chaplain to the Congress. I think by making it so general as to take in Conventions, assemblies, &amp;c., it might be used instead of that for the parliament. Adieu.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_592">&#x2014;As Col. Harrison was about to have some things packed, I set out upon the execution of your glass commission, and was surprised to find that the whole glass stores of the city could not make out anything like what you desired. I therefore did what I thought would be best, imagining you wanted the number you mentioned at any event, and that not being able to get them of that form, you would take them of any other. I therefore got 4 pint cans, 10s; 2 quart do. 8s; and six half-pint tumblers, 6s., all of double flint. So that there still remains in my hands &#xA3;4 16s., Pennsylva currcy.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_593">Your teckle is not yet come. It seems the man who had promised to sell it to the gentleman I employed to get it, now raises some difficulties either to get off others which he calls the set, or to enhance the price. However, the gentleman still expects it, and I am after him every day for it. Our galleys at <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>236<span class="bracket">]</span></span> New York have had a smart engagement with the men-of-war which went up the river; it is believed the enemy suffered a good deal. The galleys are much injured, though we lost but two men. The commander writes us word he retired, that he might go and give them another drubbing, which in plain English meant, I suppose, that he was obliged to retire. Gen. Washington commends the behavior of the men much. They lay pretty close to the enemy, and two of the galleys were exposed to the broadside of their ships almost the whole time. The damage done them proves they were in a warm situation. Madison (of the college) and one Johnson, of Augusta, were coming passengers in the New York Packet; they were attacked by one of our armed vessels, and nothing but the intervention of night prevented the packet being taken. She is arrived at New York, and they permitted to come. In a letter by them, we have intelligence that the French ministry is changed, the pacific men turned out, and those who are for war, with the Duke de Choiseul at their head, are taken in. We have also the king&#x2019;s speech on the prorogation of parliament, declaring he will see it out with us to the bitter end.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_594">The South Carolina army with Clinton Sr., arrived at Staten Island last week, one of their transports, with 5 companies of Highlanders, having first fallen into General Lee&#x2019;s hands. They now make Lord Howe 12,000 strong. With this force he is preparing to attack. He is embarking his cannon; has launched 8 galleys, and formed his men-of-war into line of battle. From these circumstances, it is believed <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>237<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the attack of New York will be within three or four days. They expect with the utmost confidence to carry it, and they consider our army but as a rude undisciplined rabble. I hope they will find it a Bunker&#x2019;s Hill rabble. Notwithstanding these appearances of attack, there are some who believe, and with appearance of reason, that these measures are taken by the enemy to secure themselves and not to attack us. A little time will shew. General Arnold (a fine sailor) has undertaken to command our fleet on the lakes. The enemy are fortifying Oswego, and I believe our army there, when recovered from their sickness, will find they have lost a good campaign, though they have had no battle of moment.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_595">My love to Mrs. Eppes. I hope my letter by last post got there time enough to stay Patty with her a while longer. Adieu.</p>

<div class="salute">Dear Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_596">&#x2014;Your&#x2019;s of Aug. 3. came to hand yesterday; having had no moment to spare since, I am obliged to set down to answer it at a Committee table while the Committee is collecting. My thoughts therefore on the subject you propose will be merely extempore. The opinion that our lands <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>238<span class="bracket">]</span></span> were allodial possessions is one which I have very long held, and had in my eye during a pretty considerable part of my law reading which I found always strengthened it. It was mentioned in a very hasty production, intended to have been put under a course of severe correction, but produced afterwards to the world in a way with which you are acquainted. This opinion I have thought &amp; still think to prove if ever I should have time to look into books again. But this is only meant with respect to the English law as transplanted here. How far our acts of assembly or acceptance of grants may have converted lands which were allodial into feuds I have never considered. This matter is now become a mere speculative point; &amp; we have it in our power to make it what it ought to be for the public good.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_597">It may be considered in the two points of view 1st. as bringing a revenue into the public treasury. 2d. as a tenure. I have only time to suggest hints on each of these heads. 1. Is it consistent with good policy or free government to establish a perpetual revenue? is it not against the practice of our wise British ancestors? have not the instances in which we have departed from this in Virginia been constantly condemned by the universal voice of our country? is it safe to make the governing power when once seated in office, independent of it&#x2019;s revenue? should we not have in contemplation &amp; prepare for an event (however deprecated) which may happen in the possibility of things; I mean a reacknowledgment of the British tyrant as our king, &amp; previously strip him of every prejudicial possession? <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>239<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Remember how universally the people run into the idea of recalling Charles the 2d after living many years under a republican government.&#x2014;As to the second was not the separation of the property from the perpetual use of lands a mere fiction? Is not it&#x2019;s history well known, &amp; the purposes for which it was introduced, to wit, the establishment of a military system of defence?</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_598">Was it not afterwards made an engine of immense oppression? Is it wanting with us for the purpose of military defence? May not it&#x2019;s other legal effects (such of them at least as are valuable) be performed in other more simple ways? Has it not been the practice of all other nations to hold their lands as their personal estate in absolute dominion? Are we not the better for what we have hitherto abolished of the feudal system? Has not every restitution of the antient Saxon laws had happy effects? Is it not better now that we return at once into that happy system of our ancestors, the wisest &amp; most perfect ever yet devised by the wit of man, as it stood before the 8th century.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_599">The idea of Congress selling out unlocated lands has been sometimes dropped, but we have always met the hint with such determined opposition that I believe it will never be proposed.&#x2014;I am against selling the lands at all. The people who will migrate to the Westward whether they form part of the old, or of a new colony will be subject to their proportion of the Continental debt then unpaid. They ought not to be subject to more. They will be a people little able to pay taxes. There is no equity in fixing upon them <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>240<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the whole burthen of this war, or any other proportion than we bear ourselves. By selling the lands to them, you will disgust them, and cause an avulsion of them from the common union. They will settle the lands in spite of everybody.&#x2014;I am at the same time clear that they should be appropriated in small quantities. It is said that wealthy foreigners will come in great numbers, &amp; they ought to pay for the liberty we shall have provided for them. True, but make them pay in settlers. A foreigner who brings a settler for every 100, or 200 acres of land to be granted him pays a better price than if he had put into the public treasury 5/ or 5&#xA3;. That settler will be worth to the public 20 times as much every year, as on our old plan he would have paid in one paiment. I have thrown these loose thoughts together only in obedience to your letter, there is not an atom of them which would not have occurred to you on a moment&#x2019;s contemplation of the subject. Charge yourself therefore with the trouble of reading two pages of such undigested stuff.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_600">By Saturday&#x2019;s post the General wrote us that Ld. Howe had got (I think 100) flat bottomed boats alongside, &amp; 30 of them were then loaded with men; by which it was concluded he was preparing to attack, yet this is Tuesday &amp; we hear nothing further. The General has by this last return, 17000 some odd men, of whom near 4000 are sick &amp; near 3000 at out posts in Long Island &amp;c. So you may say he has but 10000 effective men to defend the works of New York. His works however are good &amp; his men in spirits, which I hope will be equal to an addition of many <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>241<span class="bracket">]</span></span> thousands. He had called for 2000 men from the flying camp which were then embarking to him &amp; would certainly be with him in time even if the attack was immediate. The enemy have (since Clinton &amp; his army joined them) 15.000 men of whom not many are sick. Every influence of Congress has been exerted in vain to double the General&#x2019;s force. It was impossible to prevail on the people to leave their harvest. That is now in, &amp; great numbers are in motion, but they have no chance to be there in time. Should however any disaster befall us at New York they will form a great army on the spot to stop the progress of the enemy. I think there cannot be less than 6 or 8000 men in this city &amp; between it &amp; the flying camp. Our council complain of our calling away two of the Virginia battalions. But is this reasonable. They have no British enemy, &amp; if human reason is of any use to conjecture future events, they will not have one. Their Indian enemy is not to be opposed by their regular battalions. Other colonies of not more than half their military strength have 20 battalions in the field. Think of these things &amp; endeavor to reconcile them not only to this, but to yield greater assistance to the common cause if wanted. I wish every battalion we have was now in New York.&#x2014;We yesterday received dispatches from the Commissioners at Fort Pitt. I have not read them, but a gentleman who has, tells me they are favorable. The Shawanese &amp; Delewares are disposed to peace. I believe it, for this reason. We had by different advices information from the Shawanese that they should strike us, that this was against their will, but <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>242<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that they must do what the Senecas bid them. At that time we knew the Senecas meditated war. We directed a declaration to be made to the six nations in general that if they did not take the most decisive measures for the preservation of neutrality we would never cease waging war with them while one was to be found on the face of the earth. They immediately changed their conduct and I doubt not have given corresponding information to the Shawanese and Delewares.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_601">I hope the Cherokees will now be driven beyond the Missisipi &amp; that this in future will be declared to the Indians the invariable consequence of their beginning a war. Our contest with Britain is too serious and too great to permit any possibility of avocation from the Indians.

<div class="salute csc">Dear Page,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_605">&#x2014;We have been in hourly expectation of the great decision at New York, but it has not yet <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>243<span class="bracket">]</span></span> happened. About three nights ago an attempt was made to burn the two ships which had gone up the river. One of the two fire-rafts prepared for that purpose grappled the Phenix ten minutes, but was cleared away at last. A tender however was burnt. The two ships came down on Sunday evening and passed all our batteries again with impunity. Ld. Dunmore is at Staten isld. His sick he sent to Halifx, his effective men he carried to Staten isld. &amp; the blacks he shipped off to the West Indies. Two gentlemen who had been taken prisoners by the enemy have made their escape. They say they are now 20,000 &amp; that another division of 5,000 foreigners is still expected. They think Ld Howe will not attack these 10 days, but that he does not wait for his last division, being confident of victory without. One of these informants was captain of a continental vessel going for ammunition. The mate &amp; crew rose &amp; took the vessel. They fell in with the division of the Hessians which came with the Hessian general &amp; were brought to. The general learning from the dethroned captain what had happened, immediately threw the piratical mate into irons, &amp; had the captain to dine with him every day till they got to Halifx where he delivered him, vessel &amp;c. over to the English.&#x2014;A gentleman who lived some time in this city, but since last winter has become a resident of St. Eustatia writes that by a Dutch ship from Amsterdam they have advice that the states of Holland had refused to renew the prohibition on the exportation of powder to the colonies, or to cede to the English the Scotch brigade in their service, or to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>244<span class="bracket">]</span></span> furnish them with some men of war asked of them by the British court. This refusal so piqued the ministry that they had been enduced to take several Dutch ships, amongst which he said were two which sailed from that island &amp; were carried to London, another to St. Kitt&#x2019;s. In consequence of this the Dutch have armed 40 ships of war &amp; ordered 60 more to be built &amp; are raising 20,000 land forces. The French governor in chief of their W. Indies has not only refused to permit a capt of a man of war to make prize of our vessels in their ports but forbidden them to come within gun shot of the ports. The enemy&#x2019;s men of war being withdrawn from our whole coast to N.York gives us now fine opportunities of getting in powder. We see the effect here already.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_606">Two Canadians who had been captains in our Canadian regiment &amp; who General Gates writes us are known in the army to be worthy of good credit made their escape from St. John&#x2019;s, &amp; came over to our army from Tyconderoga; &amp; give the following intelligence. The enemy did not fortify any place we abandoned. They had 2000 men at Isle aux noix under Genl. Fraser, 2000 at St. John&#x2019;s under Carleton &amp; some at Montreal. 250 only had been left at Quebec. It was reported that 4000 English troops which were to have been a part of that army had perished at sea which gave great uneasiness. The fleet brot over timber &amp;c for 50 boats which they attempted to transport by land from the mouth of Sorel to St. John&#x2019;s, but could not for want of carriages which had been destroyed. Carleton, therefore, employed Canadians to build batteaux at St. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>245<span class="bracket">]</span></span> John&#x2019;s. He has rendered himself very odious to the Canadians by levying contributions on them in general &amp; confiscating the estates of all those who follow-lowed our army or who abscond. Great numbers of the Germans desert daily &amp; are anxiously concealed by the inhabitants. 70 Brunswickers disappeared in one day. Their officers are so much afraid of bush-fighting &amp; ambushes that they will not head any parties to pursue the runaways. The men have the same fears, which prevents them from deserting in so great numbers as is supposed they will when once our fleet shall appear cruising on the lake to receive &amp; protect them. Between the 22d &amp; 24th July Carlet on &amp; the other generals abandoned all their posts on this side Sorel except St. John&#x2019;s with as great precipitation as our poor sick army had done, carrying with them their artillery &amp; provisions. This was occasioned by the arrival and mysterious man&#x153;uvres of a fleet at Quebec supposed French, hoisting different colours &amp; firing at Tenders sent from the town to enquire who they were. 200 men were left at Isle aux noix to send them intelligence of our operations, who they say will go down the river if we return into Canada. For this event the Canadians are offering up prayers at the shrines of all their saints. Carleton some time ago hearing that we were returning with a considerable reinforcement was so terrified that he would have retired immediately had not some of his spies come in &amp; informed him of the deplorable situation to which the small pox had reduced our army.&#x2014;They are recovering health and spirits. Genl. Gates writes that he had accounts of the roads being <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>246<span class="bracket">]</span></span> crowded with militia coming to his assistance. 600 from New Hampshire came in while he was writing his letter, being the first. His fleet had sailed from Tyconderoga to Crown point. Their number and force as follows.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_607">Eight more gallies would be ready to join them in a fortnight when they would proceed down the Cape. General Arnold (who is said to be a good sailor) had undertaken the command. We have 200 fine ship carpenters (mostly sent from here) at work. I hope a fleet will soon be exhibited on that lake such as it never bore. The Indians have absolutely refused Carleton in Canada &amp; Butler at Niagara to have any thing to do in this quarrel, &amp; applaud in the highest terms our wisdom &amp; candour for not requiring them to meddle. Some of the most sensible speeches I ever saw of theirs are on this head, not to be spoken to us, but behind our backs in the councils of our enemies. From very good intelligence the Indians of the middle department will be quiet. That treaty is put off till October. Were it not that it interferes with our Assembly I would go to it, as I think something important <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>247<span class="bracket">]</span></span> might be done there, which could not be so well planned as by going to the spot &amp; seeing its geography. We have great fear that the sending an agent from Virginia to enlist Indians will have ill consequences. It breaks in upon the plan pursued here &amp; destroys that uniformity &amp; consistency of counsels which the Indians have noticed &amp; approved in their speeches. Besides they are a useless, expensive, ungovernable ally.&#x2014;I forgot to observe that a captain Mesnard of Canada had come to Genl. Gates after the two above mentioned &amp; confirmed their account in almost every article. One of the German deserters travelled with him to within 20 miles of our camp, when he was obliged to halt through fatigue. He passed 3 others of them.&#x2014;Baron Woedeke is dead, no great loss from his habit of drinking.&#x2014;The infamous Bedel &amp; Butterfield were ordered by Congress to be tried for their conduct. They have been tried by a Court martial, condemned &amp; broke with infamy. We inclose to you all the Commissions mentioned in the last letter of the delegates, except Innis&#x2019;s to be forwarded to the Eastern shore immediately, &amp; Weedon&#x2019;s &amp; Marshall&#x2019;s who we are informed are on the road hither. Would to God they were in N. York. We wait your recommendation for the 2 vacant majorities. Pray regard militaryment alone. The commissions now sent do not fix the officers to any particular battalion so that the commanding officer will dispose of them. Cannot you make use of any interest with Lee or Lewis to call Innis over to the Western shore. He pants for it, &amp; in my opinion has a right to ask it. Adieu, Adieu.</p>

That God creates men free, that his justice would not permit him to punish men for crimes they are predestinated to commit. They admit the presence of god, but distinguish between fore-knowing &amp; predestinating. All the fathers before St. Austin were of this opinion.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_625">The fundamentals of X<span class="sup">ty</span> as found in the gospels are 1. Faith, 2. Repentance.

These fundamentals are to be found in the epistles dropped here &amp; there, &amp; promiscuously mixed with other truths. But these other truths are not to be made fundamentals. They serve for edification indeed &amp; explaining to us matters in worship &amp; morality, but being written occasionally it will readily be seen that their explanations are adpated to the notions &amp; customs of the people they were written to. But yet every sentence in them (tho the writers were inspired) must not be taken up &amp; made a fundamental, without assent to which a man is not to be admitted a member of the X<span class="sup">n</span> church here, or to his kingdom hereafter. The Apostles creed was by them taken to contain all things necessary to salvation, &amp; consequently to a communion.</p>

As the Pythagoreans &amp; latter Platonists joined with the superstition of their times the Epicureans &amp; Academicks were allowed all the use of wit &amp; railery against it. Thus matters were balanced; reason had play &amp; science flourished. These contrarieties produced harmony. Superstition &amp; enthusiasm thus let alone never raged to bloodshed, persecution &amp;c. But now a new sort of policy, which considers the future lives &amp; happiness of men rather than the present, has taught to distress one another, &amp; raised an antipathy which if temporal interests could ever do now <span class="ital">uniformity</span> of opn, a hopeful project! is looked on as the only remedy agt. this evil &amp; is made the very object of govm&#x2019;t itself.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_636">Another plea for Episcopal government in Religion in England is it&#x2019;s similarity to the political governmt by a king. No bishop, no king. This then with us is a plea for government by a presbytery which resembles republican government.</p>

From the dissensions among sects themselves arises necessarily a right of chusing &amp; necessity of deliberating to which we will conform, but if we chuse for ourselves, we must allow others to chuse also, &amp; to reciprocally. This establishes religious liberty.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_644">Why require those things in order to eccliastical communion which Christ does not require in order to life eternal? How can that be the church of Christ which excludes such persons from its communion as he will one day receive into the kingdom of heaven.</p>

Must be regulat<span class="sup">n</span> but as it was a spontaneous joining of members, it follows that it&#x2019;s laws <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>266<span class="bracket">]</span></span> extend to it&#x2019;s own members only, not to those of any other voluntary society, for then by the same rule some other voluntary society might usurp power over them.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_666">Christ has said &#x2018;wheresoever 2 or 3 are gather<span class="sup">d</span>. togeth in his name he will be in the midst of them.&#x2019; This is his definition of a society. He does not make it essential that a bishop or presbyter govern them. Without them it suffices for the salvation of souls.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_667">Compulsion in religion is distinguished peculiarly from compulsion in every other thing. I may grow rich by art I am compelled to follow, I may recover health by medicines I am compelled to take ag<span class="sup">t</span>. my own judgment, but I cannot be saved by a worship I disbelieve &amp; abhor.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_668">Whatsoever is lawful in the Commonwealth, or permitted to the subject in the ordinary way, cannot be forbidden to him for religious uses: &amp; whatsoever is prejudicial to the Commonwealth in their ordinary uses &amp; therefore prohibited by the laws, ought not to be permitted to churches in their sacred rites. For instance it is unlawful in the ordinary course of things or in a private house to murder a child. It should not be permitted any sect then to sacrifice children: it is ordinarily lawful (or temporarily lawful) to kill calves or lambs. They may therefore be religiously sacrificed, but if the good of the state required a temporary suspension of killing lambs, as during a siege, sacrifices of them may then be rightfully suspended also. This is the true extent of toleration.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_669">Truth will do well enough if left to shift for herself. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>267<span class="bracket">]</span></span> She seldom has received much aid from the power of great men to whom she is rarely known &amp; seldom welcome. She has no need of force to procure entrance into the minds of men. Error indeed has often prevailed by the assistance of power or force. Truth is the proper &amp; sufficient antagonist to error. If anything pass in a religious meeting seditiously and contrary to the public peace, let it be punished in the same manner &amp; no otherwise than as if it had happened in a fair or market. These meetings ought not to be sanctuaries for faction &amp; flagitiousness.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_670">Locke denies toleration to those who entertain opns contrary to those moral rules necessary for the preservation of society; as for instance, that faith is not to be kept with those of another persuasion, that Kings excommunicated forfeit their crowns, that dominion is founded in grace, or that obedience is due to some foreign prince, or who will not own &amp; teach the duty of tolerating all men in matters of religion, or who deny the existence of a god (it was a great thing to go so far&#x2014;as he himself sais of the parl. who framed the act of tolern but where he stopped short we may go on.)<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_217" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_217_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_671">He sais &#x2018;neither Pagan nor Mahomedan nor Jew ought to be excluded from the civil rights of the Commonwealth because of his religion.&#x2019; Shall we suffer a Pagan to deal with us and not suffer him to pray to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>268<span class="bracket">]</span></span> his god? Why have X<span class="sup">ns</span>. been distinguished above all people who have ever lived, for persecutions? Is it because it is the genius of their religion? No, it&#x2019;s genius is the reverse. It is the refusing <span class="ital">toleration</span> to those of a different opn which has produced all the bustles and wars on account of religion. It was the misfortune of mankind that during the darker centuries the X<span class="sup">n</span>. priests following their ambition and avarice combining with the magistrate to divide the spoils of the people, could establish the notion that schismatics might be ousted of their possessions &amp; destroyed. This notion we have not yet cleared ourselves from. In this case no wonder the oppressed should rebel, &amp; they will continue to rebel &amp; raise disturbance until their civil rights are fully restored to them &amp; all partial distinctions, exclusions &amp; incapacitations removed.</p>

Your committee find that the said <span class="csc">Arthur Upshur</span> having several vessels on the stocks, cleared one of them out for the British West Indies on the 20th day of July, 1775, but that the said vessel was not launched until the 26th day of August; that on the 2d day of September, when the storm happened, the said vessel had no part of her loading on board; that the said vessel sailed after the 10th day of September to one of the foreign West India Islands, with a load of Indian corn; that on the 2d day of October following the Committee of the county of Accomack proceeded to inquire into the matter, and on such inquiry declared the said <span class="csc">Upshur</span> had violated the continental association by sending out the said vessel and ordered his case to be published in the <span class="ital">Virginia Gazette;</span> that after the return of the said vessel, the said <span class="csc">Upshur</span> (as appears by the minutes of the said committee) denying that he had intentionally violated the said association, voluntarily submitted the matter again to the determination of the committee, who, at a session held on the 8th day of January, 1776, upon farther enquiry, were of the opinion that he had violated the said association ignorantly, but that, having behaved obstinately, and ill afterwards, he ought to be fined, and they accordingly fined him 100&#xA3;, which sum the said <span class="csc">Upshur</span> deposited with a member of the Committee.

The commanding officer of every county within one month after every general muster shall enroll under some captain such persons not before enrolled as ought to make a part of the militia, who together with those before enrolled &amp; not yet formed into tenths <span class="ital">&amp; with such Quakers &amp; Menonists as are not formed into tenths</span> shall be such captain at his first muster after receiving the same be divided into equal parts as nearly as may be, each part to be distinguished by fair and equal lot by numbers from one to ten, &amp; when so distinguished to be added to, and make part of the division of the militia of such county already distinguished by the same number.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_720">And where any person subject to such allotment shall not attend, or shall refuse to draw for himself, the captain shall cause his lot to be drawn for him by some other in presence of the company.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_721">When any officer of the militia shall receive notice of any invasion or insurrection within his own county, he shall immediately give intelligence thereof to the commanding officer of the county &amp; if the urgency of the case requires it he shall forthwith raise the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>297<span class="bracket">]</span></span> militia under his special command &amp; proceed to oppose the enemy or insurgents: the commanding officer of the county on receiving notice thereof shall immediately if the case will admit delay or be greater than the force of his own militia may encounter, communicate the same to the Governor, by express, for which purpose he may impress boats, men &amp; horses, &amp; may also notify to any militia officer of the adjacent counties to be by him forwarded to his commanding officer &amp; in the meantime if it be urging shall raise such part of his own militia as the case shall require &amp; admit. The commanding officer of any adjacent county receiving the notice so forwarded, shall immediately raise such part of his militia, not exceeding two thirds, as the circumstances of the case may require &amp; order them to the assistance of such adjacent county: but any of the commanding officers, if he think the case of too small consequence to require these proceedings may call a council of war to consist of a majority of his field officers &amp; captains &amp; take their advice whether any &amp; what force shall be raised or sent or whether they may await the governor&#x2019;s orders.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_722">The governor on receiving such intelligence may, with the advice of the council of state cause to be embodied &amp; marched to oppose such invasion or insurrection, such members of the militia as may be needful and from such counties as will suit the exigencies of the case; &amp; if the corps consist of three or more battalions, may appoint a General officer to take command thereof.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_725">The soldiers of such militia if not well armed &amp; provided with ammunition shall be furnished with the arms &amp; ammunition of the county &amp; any deficiency in these may be supplied from the public magazines, or, if the case admit not the delay, by impressing arms &amp; ammunition of private property, which ammunition so far as not used, &amp; arms, shall be duly returned as soon as they may be spared &amp; any person embezzling any such public or private arms, or not delivering them up when required by his commanding officer shall on his warrant be committed to prison without bail or mainprise there to remain till he deliver or make full satisfaction for the same.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_726">The commanding officer shall appoint such officers of the militia as he shall think most proper to command the men called out by divisions in the following proportions: if there be called into duty not more than 15 men he shall appoint one ensign &amp; one serjeant <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>299<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to command them: if not more than 25 men a lieutenant an ensign and two serjeants; if not more than 40 men, a captain, lieutenant ensign &amp; three serjeants; if 50 men, a captain two lieutenants an ensign &amp; four serjeants; &amp; so in proportion for every greater number; adding, if there be several companies, such field officers as may be requisite. A distinct list of the names &amp; numbers of officers &amp; soldiers sent on duty, with the time they served, attested on oath by the officer commanding such party shall be certified by the commanding officer of the county to the <span class="ital">next General assembly.</span></p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_731">The commanding officer of each of the counties of Elizabeth City, Princess Anne, Northampton &amp; Accomack, with permission from the Governor, may appoint any number of men not exceeding six in each county to keep a constant lookout to seaward by night &amp; by day; who discovering any vessels appearing to belong to an enemy &amp; to propose landing or hostility, shall immediately give notice thereof to some militia officer of the county, whereon such course shall be pursued as is before directed in case of an invasion or insurrection.</p>

Messengers shall be allowed by the auditors of public accounts according to the nature of their service.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_733">Any militia officer receiving notice of an invasion or the approach of any vessel with hostile purpose, &amp; not forwarding the same to his commanding officer shall forfeit, if a field officer one hundred pounds, if a captain or subaltern fifty pounds; any commanding officer of a county receiving such notice &amp; not raising part of his militia nor taking the advice of his council of war two hundred pounds, recoverable with costs by action of debt in the name of the <span class="ital">Commonwealth</span> before any court of record, &amp; appropriated to the same uses as the fines imposed by the courtmartial of his county.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_735">Such courtmartial shall be constituted of militia officers only, of the rank of Captains or higher, &amp; shall consist of 7 members at the least whereof one shall be a county lieutenant or field officer, each of whom shall take the following oath: &#x2018;I &#x2014; do swear that I will well &amp; truly try &amp; impartially determine the cause of the prisoner now to be tried, according to the act of assembly for providing against <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>302<span class="bracket">]</span></span> invasions &amp; insurrections so help me god,&#x2019; which oath shall be administered to the presiding officer by the next in command, &amp; then by such presiding officer to the other members.

All persons called to give evidence shall take the usual oath of evidence, to be administered by the clerk of the court.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_742">Matters in our part of the continent are too much in quiet to send you news from hence. Our battalions for the continental service were some time ago so far filled as rendered the recommendation of a draught from the militia hardly requisite, and the more so as in this country it ever was the most unpopular <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>305<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and impracticable thing that could be attempted. Our people, even under the monarchical government, had learnt to consider it as the last of all oppressions. I learn from our delegates that the confederation is again on the carpet, a great and a necessary work, but I fear almost desperate. The point of representation is what most alarms me, as I fear the great and small colonies are bitterly determined not to cede. Will you be so good as to collect the proposition I formerly made you in private, and try if you can work it into some good to save our union? It was, that any proposition might be negatived by the representatives of a majority of the people of America, or of a majority of the colonies of America. The former secures the larger, the latter, the smaller colonies. I have mentioned it to many here. The good whigs, I think, will so far cede their opinions for the sake of the Union, and others we care little for.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_743">The journals of Congress not being printed earlier, gives more uneasiness than I would wish ever to see produced by any act of that body, from whom alone I know our salvation can proceed. In our Assembly, even the best affected think it an indignity to freemen to be voted away, life and fortune, in the dark. Our House have lately written for a manuscript copy of your journals, not meaning to desire a communication of any thing ordered to be kept secret. I wish the regulation of the post-office, adopted by Congress last September, could be put in practice. It was for the travel night and day, and to go their several stages three times a week. The speedy and frequent communication of intelligence is really of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>306<span class="bracket">]</span></span> great consequence. So many falsehoods have been propagated that nothing now is believed unless coming from Congress or camp. Our people, merely for want of intelligence which they may rely on, are become lethargic and insensible of the state they are in. Had you ever a leisure moment, I should ask a letter from you sometimes, directed to the care of Mr. Dick, Fredericksburgh; but having nothing to give in return, it would be a tax on your charity as well as your time. The esteem I have for you privately, as well as for your public importance, will always render assurances of your health and happiness agreeable. I am, dear sir, your friend and servant.</p>

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_744">&#x2014;I forbear to write you news, as the time of Mr. Short&#x2019;s departure being uncertain, it might be old before you receive it, and he can, in person, possess you of all we have. With respect to the State of Virginia in particular, the people seem to have laid aside the monarchical, and taken up the republican government, with as much ease as would have attended their throwing off an old, and putting on a new suit of clothes. Not a single throe has attended this important transformation. A half-dozen aristocratical gentlemen, agonizing under the loss of pre-eminence, have sometimes ventured their sarcasms on our political metamorphosis. They have been thought fitter objects of pity, than of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>307<span class="bracket">]</span></span> punishment. We are, at present, in the complete and quiet exercise of well-organized government, save only that our courts of justice do not open till the fall. I think nothing can bring the security of our continent and its cause into danger, if we can support the credit of our paper. To do that, I apprehend, one of two steps must be taken. Either to procure free trade by alliance with some naval power able to protect it; or, if we find there is no prospect of that, to shut our ports totally, to all the world, and turn our colonies into manufactories. The former would be most eligible, because most conformable to the habits and wishes of our people. Were the British Court to return to their senses in time to seize the little advantage which still remains within their reach, from this quarter, I judge, that, on acknowledging our absolute independence and sovereignty, a commercial treaty beneficial to them, and perhaps even a league of mutual offence and defence, might, not seeing the expense or consequences of such a measure, be approved by our people, if nothing, in the mean time, done on your part, should prevent it. But they will continue to grasp at their desperate sovereignty, till every benefit short of that is forever out of their reach. I wish my domestic situation had rendered it possible for me to join you in the very honorable charge confided to you.

<div class="salute csc">Dear Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_745">&#x2014;Your favor of May 26 came safely to hand. I wish it were in my power to suggest any remedy for the evil you complain of, tho&#x2019; did any occur I should propose it to you with great diffidence after knowing you had thought on the subject yourself. There is indeed a fact which may not have come to your knolege out of which perhaps some little good may be drawn. The borrowing money in Europe (or obtaining credit there for necessaries) has already probably been essayed &amp; it is supposed with some degree of success. But I expect your applications have as yet been only to France, Holland, or such other states as are of principal note. There is however a small power, well disposed to our cause, &amp;, as I am informed, possessed of abilities to assist us in this way. I speak of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. The little states of Italy you know have had long peace, &amp; shew no disposition to interrupt that peace shortly. The Grand Duke being somewhat avaricious in his nature has availed himself of the opportunity of collecting &amp; hoarding what money he has been able to gather. I am informed from good authority (an officer who was concerned in the business of his treasury<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_239" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_239_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a>) that about three years ago he had ten millions of crowns, lying dead in his coffers. Of this it is thought possible as much might be borrowed as would amount to a million of pounds lawful money. At any rate <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>309<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the attempt might be worth making. Perhaps an application from Dr. Franklin who has some acquaintance in that court might be sufficient, or, as it might be prudent to sound well before the application, in order to prevent the discredit of a rebuff, perhaps Congress would think it worth while to send a special agent there to negotiate the matter. I think we have a gentleman here who would do it with dexterity &amp; fidelity. He is a native of that Duchy; well connected there, conversant in courts of great understanding &amp; equal zeal in our cause. He came over not long since to introduce the cultivation of vines, olives, &amp;c among us. Should you think the matter worth a further thought, either of the Cols. Lees to whom he is known can acquaint you more fully of his character. If the money can be obtained in specie it may be applied to reduce the quantity of circulating paper &amp; be so managed as to help the credit of that which will remain in circulation. If credit alone can be obtained for the manufactures of the country, it will still help to clothe our armies or to increase at market the necessaries our people want.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_746">What upon earth can Howe mean by the man&#x153;uvre he is now practicing? There seems to me no object in this country which can be either of utility or reputation to his cause. I hope it will prove of a piece with all the other follies they have committed. The forming a junction with the Northern army up the Hudson&#x2019;s river, or taking possession of Philadelphia might have been a feather in his cap, &amp; given them a little reputation in Europe. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>310<span class="bracket">]</span></span> The former as being the design with which they came, the latter as being a place of the first reputation abroad &amp; the residence of Congress. Here he may destroy the little hamlet of Wmsbgh, steal a few slaves, &amp; lose half his army among the fens &amp; marshes of our lower country or by the heat of the climate. I am, dear sir, yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_747">Mr. Jefferson reported, from the Committee appointed to draw up what is proper to be offered at the conference proposed with the Senate, on the subject matter of their amendments to the resolution of this House for paying to Thomas Johnson the sum of 15&#xA3; 5s 6d. that the committee had accordingly drawn up what they think would be proper to be offered at the said conference, which they had directed him to report to the said House; he read the report in his place, and afterwards delivered it in at the clerks table, where the same was read and is as followeth, viz:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_748">The House of Delegates has desired this conference, in order to preserve that harmony and friendly correspondence with the Senate, which is necessary for the discharge of their joint duties of legislation, and to prevent, both now and in future, the delay of public business, and injury which may accrue to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>311<span class="bracket">]</span></span> individuals, should the two Houses differ in opinion as to the distinct office of each.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_749">Though during the course of the last two, and also of the present session of Assembly, they have acquiesced, under some amendments made by the Senate to votes for allowing public claims and demands, yet they are of opinion that an adherence to fundamental principles is the most likely way to save both time and disagreement; and a departure from them may at some time or other be drawn into precedent for dangerous innovations, and that therefore it is better for both Houses, and for those by whom they are entrusted, to correct the error while new, and before it becomes inveterate by habit and custom.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_750">The constitution having declared that &#x201C;money bills shall in no instance be altered by the Senate, but wholly approved or rejected,&#x201D; the delegates are of opinion the Senate had no authority to amend their late vote for allowing to Thomas Johnson the sum of fifteen pounds five shillings and six pence; and should the term &#x201C;money bills&#x201D; in the constitution not immediately convey the precise idea which the framers of that act intended to express, it is supposed that its explanation should be sought for in the institutions of that people, among whom alone a distinction between money bills and other acts of legislation is supposed to have been made, and from whom we, and others, emigrating from them, have indisputably copied it.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_751">By the law and usage of their parliament then, all those are understood to be &#x201C;money bills&#x201D; which <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>312<span class="bracket">]</span></span> raise money in any way, or which dispose of it, and which regulate those circumstances of matter, method and time, which attend as of consequence on the right of giving and disposing. Again the law and customs of their parliament, which include the usage as to &#x201C;money bills&#x201D; are a part of the law of their land; our ancestors adopted their system of law in the general, making from time to time such alterations as local diversities required; but that part of their law which relates to the matter now in question, was never altered by our legislature, in any period of its history; but on the contrary, the two Houses of Assembly, both under our regal and republican governments, have ever done business on the constant admission that the law of parliament was their law. When the delegates, therefore, vote that fifteen pounds five shillings and six pence, whether raised or to be raised on the people shall be disposed of in payment to Thomas Johnson for losses sustained by him on the public behalf, this is a vote for the disposal of money, which the Senate are at liberty to approve or reject in the whole, but cannot amend by altering the sum.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_752">The delegates, therefore, hope that the Senate will concur with them in a strict and mutual observance of those laws by which both houses are bound, and they are well assured, that this subject being properly stated to the Senate, they will forbear in future, to exercise a practice which seems not authorised, but, if there should be found any difference of opinion on this point, the delegates will be ready to join in any regular proposition for defining <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>313<span class="bracket">]</span></span> with precision, the subject of their difference, so as to prevent all doubts and delays in future.</p>

<div class="opener">
<div class="dateline">Friday, <div class="date 1778-01-09">Jan. 9, 1778</div>.</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_753">Mr. Jefferson reported from the Committee, appointed to prepare reasons to be offered to the Senate, at the conference to be desired of them on the subject of the last conference; that the committee had accordingly prepared, what they thought would be proper to be offered at the said conference; and he read the same in his place, and afterwards delivered it in at the clerk&#x2019;s table, where the same was read, and is as followeth, viz:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_754">Reasons, to be offered at the conference to be desired of the Senate, in answer to their reasons delivered at the last conference:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_755">The House of Delegates, not being satisfied with the reasons urged by the Senate, in support of their amendments to the resolution for allowing Thomas Johnson the sum of 15&#xA3; 5s. 6d., have desired this second conference to shew the insufficiency of the said reasons, and to propose that some expedient may be adopted by the two Houses, for reconciling their difference of opinion.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_756">The resemblance between the constituent parts of our legislature, and that of Great Britain, is supposed by the Senate, so faint, that no ground remains for those jealousies, which have prompted the Commons of Great Britain against their House of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>314<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Lords. This might have been, and doubtless was, urged, at the time our constitution was formed, as a reason why the Senate and Delegates should have equal powers of money bills. But the argument having been overruled, and the powers of the Senate, as to this point, being fixed, by the constitution, on the same restricted footing, with those of the Lords in the British legislature, it is conceived not to be the proper question of this day, whether the resemblance between them, in general, be faint or strong, well or ill-grounded, but, whether the constitution has not made them, to resemble in this point.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_757">Had those who framed the constitution, as soon as they had completed that work, been asked, man by man, what a money bill was, it is supposed that man by man, they would have referred for answer to the well known laws and usages of Parliament, or, would have formed their answer, on the Parliamentary idea of that term. Its import, at this day, must be the same as it was then. And it would be unreasonable, now, to send us to seek its definition in the subsequent proceedings of that body, as it would have been for them, at that day, to have referred us to such proceedings before they had come into existence. The meaning of the term, must be supposed complete, at the time they use it; and to be sought for, in those resources only, which existed at the time. Constructions, which do not result from the words of the legislator, but lie hidden in his breast, till called forth, <span class="ital">ex post facto,</span> by subsequent occasions, are dangerous, and not to be justified by ordinary emergencies.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>315<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_758">Nor do we, by this, set up the Parliament of England, as the expositor of our constitution, but the law of Parliament, as it existed, and was evidenced by usage, at the time the term in question was inserted in our instrument of government; a law coeval with the common law itself, and no more liable, as adopted by us, to subsequent change, from that body, than their common or statute law, which we have in like manner adopted. To suppose this branch of law, not existing in our code, would shake the foundation of our whole legal system; since every legislative proposition which has been passed or rejected since the first establishment of a legislature in this country, has been determined to be law, or not law, by the forms of Parliamentary proceeding.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_759">With as little justice may it be said, that this is referring for the definition of a term, to multiplied disputes, which have for ages agitated the Parliament of England, and which no time will decide; that it is proving what is clear, by what is very obscure; and unsettling what is fixed: since we conceive that researches into Parliamentary history, will decisively shew, that their practice in this matter has been clear, fixed, and ancient; and, that for ages past, it has produced no agitation, unless we call by that name some groundless assertions of the Lords in the course of the last century. Yet, these assertions they departed from in practice, at the very time they advanced them: and at all times after, they stand contradicted by the declarations of the Commons, and the constant usage of both Houses; which, agreeing together, are supposed to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>316<span class="bracket">]</span></span> form the strongest evidence what the law of Parliament is on this point.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_760">To prove this right, as uniformly claimed and exercised by the Commons, and assented to in practice by the Lords, the Delegates will subjoin some proceedings of Parliament, in addition to the passage cited by the Senate.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_761">That a bill, for raising money by way of taxes, is a money bill, is admitted by the Senate, and need not therefore be proved.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_762">That bills, for raising money by rates, and impositions on merchandise, are also considered as money bills, will appear, on recurring to the Parliamentary proceedings of 1671, in which it is affirmed, &#x201C;that there is a fundamental right in the House of Commons alone, in bills of rates and impositions on merchandise, as to the matter, the measure, and the time;&#x201D; and also, by their declaration of 1689, &#x201C;that the Commons have always taken it for their undoubted privilege (of which they have been tender and jealous) that, in all aids given to the King by the Commons, the rate or tax ought not to be any way altered by the Lords,&#x201D; which is supposed to be the passage cited by the Senate, as of the year 1671.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_763">That bills, for applying forfeitures in aid of the public revenue are not amendable by the Lords, appears by the proceedings of 1700, on the bill &#x201C;for applying Irish forfeitures to the use of the public,&#x201D; to which the Lords were not permitted to make any amendments.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_764">The right of levying money, in whatever way, being thus exercised by the Commons, as their exclusive <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>317<span class="bracket">]</span></span> office, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that they may also exclusively direct its application. &#x201C;Cujus est dare, ejus est disponere,&#x201D; is an elementary principle, both of law and of reason: That he who gives, may direct the application of the gift: or, in other words, may dispose of it: that if he may give absolutely, he may also carve out the conditions, limitations, purposes, and measure of the gift, seems as evidently true, as, that the greater power contains the lesser.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_765">Parliamentary usage, has accordingly, approved this reasoning.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_766">In July, 1678, the Commons resolved, &#x201C;that it is their undoubted and sole right, to direct, limit, and appoint, in all aids and supplies granted to the King, the ends, purposes, considerations, limitations, and qualifications, of such grants; which ought not to be changed by the House of Lords.&#x201D;</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_767">In December of the same year, the Commons having directed the payment of money, and the Lords proposed an amendment thereto, the former declared &#x201C;that their Lordships never before changed any such disposition made on a supply granted by the Commons.&#x201D;</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_768">In 1701, the Lords having amended a bill, &#x201C;for stating and examining the public accounts,&#x201D; by inserting a clause for allowing a particular debt, the Commons disagreed to the amendment; and declared for a reason, &#x201C;that the disposition, as well as granting, of money by act of Parliament, hath ever been in the House of Commons; and, that the amendment relating to the disposal of money, does <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>318<span class="bracket">]</span></span> entrench upon that right.&#x201D; And, to a bill of the same nature, the year following, the Lords having proposed an amendment, and declared &#x201C;That their right in granting, limiting, and disposing public aids, being the main hinge of the controversy, they thought it of the highest concern that it should be cleared and settled.&#x201D; They then go on to prove the usage, by precedents, and declarations, and, from these conclude, &#x201C;That the limitation, disposition, and manner of account, belong only to them.&#x201D;</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_769">In reply, the Lords said, &#x201C;They declined all arguments concerning the rights of the Commons in granting, limiting and disposing public aids; and, therefore, forbore to answer any arguments of that kind&#x201D;; but proceeded to insist that the business then depending was of quite another nature. And, at some subsequent conferences between the two Houses, during the same session, it was repeatedly declared, &#x201C;That the Lords could not supply any deficiency, or apply any surplusage of the public money, and in case any should be found.&#x201D; And this declaration does not appear to have been contradicted by the Lords, either then or at any time after.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_770">The precedents are supposed to prove, not only that the disposal or application of public money is, equally with the raising of it, the exclusive office of the Commons, but also, that it makes no difference whether it be of money then actually in the treasury, or yet to be raised on the people; nor whether the raising and disposing be in the same or in separate bills.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>319<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_771">Though the precedents referred to by the Senate, in the proceedings of the Council and House of Burgesses, in the years 1771, 1772, and 1773, (the first of which, however, we suppose to be mistaken for 1772) might perhaps be well accounted for from their particular nature, from the history of the times, or from other causes; and though the delegates might produce, from the same records, proofs, much more decisive in their favor, yet they decline resting the matter on that bottom: because, they are of opinion, that the present determination ought not to be influenced by the practice of those who have themselves only copied from the same original. Their practice, and our opinions, must be proved by the same common rule,&#x2014;the law and practice of Parliament. Their acknowledgment of the rule, proves their submission to it, and that their practice should be tried by the law, and not the law by their practice.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_772">How dangerous it is to appeal to other authorities from the Parliamentary records, the true text of decision, will appear also by examining the whole passage, of which a part only was cited from the Commentaries of Judge Blackstone; a writer, celebrated indeed; but, whether most for his attachment to the prerogatives of the crown, or to the rights of the people, would be worthy of consideration, where the question is on one of those rights, which have been of the greatest value to the people&#x2014;the right of giving and disposing of their own money. That writer, after the definition cited from his book by the Senate, goes on to quote a passage <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>320<span class="bracket">]</span></span> from Judge Hale&#x2019;s treatise on the jurisdiction of Parliament, which is to be found more at large in Broke&#x2019;s Abridgement, under the title &#x201C;Parliament, Pl. 4:&#x201D; there it appears to be a saying of Kerbie, a clerk of the Parliament, who lays down in express terms, or by direct implication, these following positions, as of the law of Parliament:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_773">1st. That the Lords may amend a bill for granting aids.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_774">2nd. That, if the amendment be by shortening the duration of the grant, they need not return the bill to the Commons for their concurrence.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_775">3rd. That the King may alter a bill.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_776">Broke indeed adds a quere to the case; but that Judge Blackstone, disapproved of it, cannot be inferred from his words. It is therefore submitted to the consideration of the Senate, whether they would set up as an arbiter of Parliamentary law, a writer who can cite or refer to such positions, whether condemning them, in decisive and unequivocal terms; for that part of his book, too, which the Senate quote and rely on, he cites no authority whatever. Are we then to take it upon his affirmation, when contradicted by the uniform current of Parliamentary usage? But, waiving further examination of the legality of his opinion, it suffices to observe, as a full answer to it, that the judges of the common law can take no cognizance of the law of Parliament. It can never come judicially in question before them. Their sayings or opinions on the subject, must be ever extra-judicial; and they have accordingly always disclaimed a right to give judgment on them. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>321<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Definitions therefore, of Parliamentary law, by any other court, by a member of court, or by a private individual, must be rejected as inauthoritative in a Parliamentary disquisition.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_777">For these reasons, the delegates still think, that the Senate have no authority to amend the vote in question. But open to conviction, if it can be shown they are wrong, and actuated by a strong desire to promote the public service, as well as to preserve the Constitution entire, they propose to the Senate, if they should still adhere to their former opinions, that a select committee may be appointed by each House, to meet together in full conference, and endeavor to define the office of the two Houses in bills, clauses, and votes, relating to money, and that such definition, if approved by both Houses, may be confirmed by act of Assembly.</p>

And when the assessors shall have noted therein the number of slaves for which they shall have assessed a pound rate on the proprietor the commissioners shall extend against such proprietor the tax aforesd in lieu of the pound rate on the sd slaves extended by the assessors; and where they shall not have so noted the number of slaves they shall be required by the sd Commissioners forthwith to do it.

And doubts having arisen where slaves are hired whether the sd pound rate should be paid by the owner or hirer, and as a like doubt may arise as to the tax hereby imposed, it is declared that the sd tax is paiable by the owner, unless otherwise settled by contract between the parties.</p>

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_808">&#x2014;I am now to acknowledge the receipt of two of your favors, during the session of Assembly, but there being little to communicate to you, and that, being a busy time with me, has prevented my doing it sooner. The Assembly rose on Monday last; their only act which can shortly aid our army, was one for raising a regiment of horse, which, I think, will be raised as fast as it can be accoutred. Another act they passed, will also produce aid to our army, I hope, but it will be some [delay?] first; it was for giving great encouragement to soldiers, and appointing recruiting officers all over the country, to attend all publick places. By a third act, they foolishly repeated the experiment of raising volunteers; the first attempt was pardonable, because its ill-success could not be foreseen; the second is worse than ridiculous, because it may deceive our friends; I am satisfied there will not be a company raised. I wish Congress would commute a good part of the infantry required from us, for an equivalent force in horse. This service opens us a new fund of young men, who have not yet stepped forth; I mean those whose indolence or education, has unfitted them for foot service; this may be worth your thinking of. We passed the bill of pardon, recommended by Congress, but the Senate rejected it. Your letter, about enlarging your powers over the confederation, was not proceeded on, because the nature of the enlargement was not chalked out <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>338<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by you so intelligibly as enabled the house to do anything, unless they had given a carteblanche. Indeed, I believe, that, had the alterations proposed been specified unless they had been mere form indeed, it might have been difficult to obtain their consent. A Frenchman arrived here a week ago, with a vast cargo of woolens, made and unmade, stockings, shoes, &amp;c. fit for the army, fifty thousand weight of powder, and other articles; the master had once sold the whole cargo, to the governor and council, for 5s 3p the livre, first cost; but, on suggestions from some of our forestallers, and those from Maryland, he flew off. Our bay is clear of the enemy. Nothing new here. I set out for Albemarle, within a day or two. Mr. Harvie will be with you in about three weeks. My complements to your brethren of the delegation, and am, dear sir, Your friend and servant,</p>

<div class="salute csc">Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_810">&#x2014;Your letter of Sep. 15. 1777 from Paris comes safe to hand. We have not however had the pleasure of seeing Mr. De Cenis, the bearer of it in this country, as he joined the army in Pennsylvania as soon as he arrived. I should have taken particular pleasure in serving him on your recommendation. From the kind anxiety expressed in your letter as well as from other sources of information we discover that our enemies have filled Europe with <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>339<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Thrasonic accounts of victories they had never won and conquests they were fated never to make. While these accounts alarmed our friends in Europe they afforded us diversion. We have long been out of all fear for the event of the war. I enclose you a list of the killed, wounded, and captives of the enemy from the commencement of hostilities at Lexington in April, 1775, until November, 1777, since which there has been no event of any consequence. This is the best history of the war which can be brought within the compass of a letter. I believe the account to be near the truth, tho&#x2019; it is difficult to get at the numbers lost by an enemy with absolute precision. Many of the articles have been communicated to us from England as taken from the official returns made by their General. I wish it were in my power to send you as just an account of our loss. But this cannot be done without an application to the war office which being in another county is at this time out of my reach. I think that upon the whole it has been about one half the number lost by them, in some instances more, but in others less. This difference is ascribed to our superiority in taking aim when we fire; every soldier in our army having been intimate with his gun from his infancy. If there could have been a doubt before as to the event of the war it is now totally removed by the interposition of France, &amp; the generous alliance she has entered into with us. Tho&#x2019; much of my time is employed in the councils of America I have yet a little leisure to indulge my fondness for philosophical studies. I could wish to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>340<span class="bracket">]</span></span> correspond with you on subjects of that kind. It might not be unacceptable to you to be informed for instance of the true power of our climate as discoverable from the thermometer, from the force &amp; direction of the winds, the quantity of rain, the plants which grow without shelter in winter &amp;c. On the other hand we should be much pleased with cotemporary observations on the same particulars in your country, which will give us a comparative view of the two climates. Farenheit&#x2019;s thermometer is the only one in use with us, I make my daily observations as early as possible in the morning &amp; again about 4 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, these generally showing the maxima of cold &amp; heat in the course of 24 hours. I wish I could gratify your Botanical taste; but I am acquainted with nothing more than the first principles of that science; yet myself &amp; my friends may furnish you with any Botanical subjects which this country affords, and are not to be had with you; and I shall take pleasure in procuring them when pointed out by you. The greatest difficulty will be the means of conveyance during the continuance of the war.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_811">If there is a gratification which I envy any people in this world, it is to your country its music. This is the favorite passion of my soul, &amp; fortune has cast my lot in a country where it is in a state of deplorable barbarism. From the line of life in which we conjecture you to be, I have for some time lost the hope of seeing you here. Should the event prove so, I shall ask your assistance in procuring a substitute, who may be a proficient in singing, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>341<span class="bracket">]</span></span> &amp; on the Harpsichord. I should be contented to receive such an one two or three years hence, when it is hoped he may come more safely and find here a greater plenty of those useful things which commerce alone can furnish. The bounds of an American fortune will not admit the indulgence of a domestic band of musicians, yet I have thought that a passion for music might be reconciled with that economy which we are obliged to observe. I retain for instance among my domestic servants a gardener (Ortolans), a weaver (Tessitore di lino e lin), a cabinet maker (Stipeltaio) and a stone cutter (Scalpellino laborante in piano) to which I would add a vigneron. In a country where like yours music is cultivated and practised by every class of men I suppose there might be found persons of those trades who could perform on the French horn, clarinet or hautboy &amp; bassoon, so that one might have a band of two French horns, two clarinets, &amp; hautboys &amp; a bassoon, without enlarging their domestic expenses. A certainty of employment for a half dozen years, and at the end of that time to find them if they choose a conveyance to their own country might induce them to come here on reasonable wages. Without meaning to give you trouble, perhaps it might be practicable for you in [your] ordinary intercourse with your people, to find out such men disposed to come to America. Sobriety and good nature would be desirable parts of their characters. If you think such a plan practicable, and will be so kind as to inform me what will be necessary to be done on my part I will take care <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>342<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that it shall be done. The necessary expenses, when informed of them, I can remit before they are wanting, to any port in France, with which country alone we have safe correspondence. I am Sir with much esteem your humble servant.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_817">&#x2014;Mr. Madison I believe informed you by letter written some time ago that one of your boxes of books left in his care burst open in removing it from the college to the president&#x2019;s house for greater security. This accident discovered them to be in a state of ruin. They had contracted a dampness &amp; stuck together in large blocks, insomuch that they could not sometimes be separated without tearing the cover. I happened to be in town &amp; was of opinion with Mr. Madison that it was necessary to overhaul them and give them air. Indeed we both thought&#x2014;I think it would be for your interest to have them sold, as books are now in considerable demand here, and, packed as they are in boxes, they must sustain injury. There are many of them which I would be glad to take myself at their stirling cost and would remit you the money by the way of France. That cost might be fixed either by note from yourself, informing me what they cost you, or by the estimate of anybody here in whom you trust. Upon a presumption that you could not but approve of the proposal to have them disposed of &amp; the money remitted, for the reasons before given &amp; others which you may apprehend but would be improper for me to explain, I have taken the liberty of laying apart many of them for myself, leaving with Mr. Madison a catalogue of them, and ready to return them to him if <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>344<span class="bracket">]</span></span> you shall direct it. I shall be glad of your answer as soon as possible, and will gladly serve you in the care of any interest you may have left here. The reasons are obvious which restrain this letter to matters of business. As soon as the obstacles to friendly correspondence are removed I shall be glad at all times to hear from you.

<div class="salute csc">Dear Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_818">&#x2014;I sincerely congratulate you on the recovery of Philadelphia, and wish it may be found uninjured by the enemy&#x2014;how far the interests of literature may have suffered by the injury or removal of the Orrery (as it is miscalled) the publick libraries, your papers &amp; implements, are doubts which still excite anxiety. We were much disappointed in Virginia generally on the day of the great eclipse, which proved to be cloudy. In Williamsburgh, where it was total, I understand only the beginning was seen. At this place which is in Lat. 38&#xB0;-8&#x2032; and Longitude West from Williamsburgh about 1&#xB0;-45&#x2032; as is conjectured, eleven digits only were supposed to be covered, as it was not seen at all till the moon had advanced nearly one third over the sun&#x2019;s disc. Afterwards it was seen at intervals <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>345<span class="bracket">]</span></span> through the whole. The egress particularly was visible. It proved however of little use to me for want of a time piece that could be depended on; which circumstance, together with the subsequent restoration of Philadelphia to you, has induced me to trouble you with this letter to remind you of your kind promise of making me an accurate clock; which being intended for astronomical purposes only, I would have divested of all apparatus for striking or for any other purpose, which by increasing it&#x2019;s complication might disturb it&#x2019;s accuracy. A companion to it, for keeping seconds, and which might be moved easily, would greatly add to it&#x2019;s value. The theodolite, for which I spoke to you also, I can now dispense with, having since purchased a most excellent one.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_819">Writing to a philosopher, I may hope to be pardoned for intruding some thoughts of my own tho&#x2019; they relate to him personally. Your time for two years past has, I believe, been principally employed in the civil government of your country. Tho&#x2019; I have been aware of the authority our cause would acquire with the world from it&#x2019;s being known that yourself &amp; Doct<span class="sup">r</span>. Franklin were zealous friends to it and am myself duly impressed with a sense of the arduousness of government, and the obligation those are under who are able to conduct it, yet I am also satisfied there is an order of geniusses above that obligation, &amp; therefore exempted from it, nobody can conceive that nature ever intended to throw away a Newton upon the occupations of a crown. It would have been a prodigality for which even the conduct <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>346<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of providence might have been arraigned, had he been by birth annexed to what was so far below him. Cooperating with nature in her ordinary economy we should dispose of and employ the geniusses of men according to their several orders and degrees. I doubt not there are in your country many persons equal to the task of conducting government: but you should consider that the world has but one Ryttenhouse, &amp; that it never had one before. The amazing mechanical representation of the solar system which you conceived &amp; executed, has never been surpassed by any but the work of which it is a copy. Are those powers then, which being intended for the erudition of the world are, like air and light, the world&#x2019;s common property, to be taken from their proper pursuit to do the commonplace drudgery of governing a single state, a work which may be executed by men of an ordinary stature, such as are always &amp; everywhere to be found? Without having ascended mount Sinai for inspiration, I can pronounce that the precept, in the decalogue of the vulgar, that they shall not make to themselves &#x201C;the likeness of anything that is in the heavens above&#x201D; is reversed for you, and that you will fulfill the highest purposes of your creation by employing yourself in the perpetual breach of that inhibition. For my own country in particular you must remember something like a promise that it should be adorned with one of them. The taking of your city by the enemy has hitherto prevented the proposition from being made &amp; approved by our legislature. The zeal of a true whig in science must <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>347<span class="bracket">]</span></span> excuse the hazarding these free thoughts, which flow from a desire of promoting the diffusion of knowledge &amp; of your fame, and from one who can assure you truly that he is with much sincerity &amp; esteem Your most obed<span class="sup">t</span>. &amp; most humble serv<span class="sup">t</span>.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_820">P. S. If you can spare as much time as to give me notice of the receipt of this, &amp; what hope I may form of my clocks, it will oblige me. If sent to Fredericksburgh it will come safe to hand.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_827">&#x2014;Since I left you I have reflected on the bill regulating the practising of attornies, &amp; of our omitting to continue the practitioners at the County &amp; General Courts separate. I think the bar of the General Court a proper &amp; an excellent nursery for future judges if it be so regulated as that science may be encouraged &amp; may live there. But this can never be if an inundation of insects is permitted to come from the county courts &amp; consume the harvest. These people traversing the counties seeing the clients frequently at their own courts, or, perhaps at their own houses must of necessity pick up all the business. The convenience of frequently seeing their counsel without going from home cannot be withstood by the country people. Men of science then (if there were to be any) would only be employed as auxiliary counsel in difficult cases. But can they live by that? Certainly not. The present <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>350<span class="bracket">]</span></span> members of that kind therefore must turn marauders in the county courts; &amp; in future none will have leisure to acquire science. I should therefore be for excluding the county court attorneys, or rather for taking the general court lawyers from the incessant drudgery of the county courts &amp; confining them to their studies that they may qualify themselves as well to support their clients as to become worthy successors to the bench. I hope to see the time when the election of Judges of the Supreme Courts shall be restrained to the bars of the General Court &amp; High Court of Chancery, for when I speak of the former above, I mean to include the latter. I should even in our present bills have no objections to inserting such a restriction to take place seven or fourteen years hene. Adieu.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_829">&#x2014;A report prevailing here, that in consequence of some powers from Congress, the Governor and Council have it in contemplation to remove the Convention troops, either wholly or in part, from their present situation, I take the liberty of troubling you with some observations on that subject. The reputation and interest of our country, in general, may be affected by such a measure: it would, therefore, hardly be deemed an indecent liberty in the most private citizen, to offer his thoughts to the consideration of the Executive. The locality of my <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>351<span class="bracket">]</span></span> situation, particularly in the neighborhood of the present barracks, and the public relation in which I stand to the people among whom they are situated, together with a confidence which a personal knowledge of the members of the Executive gives me, that they will be glad of information from any quarter, on a subject interesting to the public, induce me to hope that they will acquit me of impropriety in the present representation.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_830">By an article in the Convention of Saratoga, it is stipulated, on the part of the United States, that the officers shall not be separated from their men. I suppose the term officers, includes <span class="ital">general</span> as well as <span class="ital">regimental</span> officers. As there are general officers who command all the troops, no part of them can be separated from these officers without a violation of the article: they cannot, of course, be separated from one another, unless the same general officer could be in different places at the same time. It is true, the article adds the words, &#x201C;as far as circumstances will admit.&#x201D; This was a necessary qualification; because, in no place in America, I suppose, could there have been found quarters for both officers and men together; those for the officers to be according to their rank. So far, then, as the circumstances of the place where they should be quartered, should render a separation necessary, in order to procure quarters for the officers, according to their rank, the article admits that separation. And these are the circumstances which must have been under the contemplation of the parties; both of whom, and all the world beside (who are ultimate judges in the case), <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>352<span class="bracket">]</span></span> would still understand that they were to be as near in the environs of the camp, as convenient quarters could be procured; and not that the qualification of the article destroyed the article itself, and laid it wholly at our discretion. Congress, indeed, have admitted of this separation; but are they so far lords of right and wrong as that our consciences may be quiet with their dispensation? Or is the case amended by saying they leave it optional in the Governor and Council to separate the troops or not? At the same time that it exculpates not them, it is drawing the Governor and Council into a participation in the breach of faith. If indeed it is only proposed, that a separation of the troops shall be referred to the consent of their officers; that is a very different matter. Having carefully avoided conversation with them on public subjects, I cannot say, of my own knowledge, how they would relish such a proposition. I have heard from others, that they will choose to undergo anything together, rather than to be separated, and that they will remonstrate against it in the strongest terms. The Executive, therefore, if voluntary agents in this measure, must be drawn into a paper war with them, the more disagreeable, as it seems that faith and reason will be on the other side. As an American, I cannot help feeling a thorough mortification, that our Congress should have permitted an infraction of our public honor; as a citizen of Virginia, I cannot help hoping and confiding, that our Supreme Executive, whose acts will be considered as the acts of the Commonwealth, estimate that honor too highly to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>353<span class="bracket">]</span></span> make its infraction their own act. I may be permitted to hope, then, that if any removal takes place, it will be a general one; and, as it is said to be left to the Governor and Council to determine on this, I am satisfied that, suppressing every other consideration, and weighing the matter dispassionately, they will determine upon this sole question, Is it for the benefit of those for whom they act, that the Convention troops should be removed from among them? Under the head of interest, these circumstances, viz., the expense of building barracks, said to have been &#xA3;25,000, and of removing the troops backwards and forwards, amounting to, I know not how much, are not to be permitted, merely because they are Continental expenses; for we are a part of the Continent; we must pay a shilling of every dollar wasted. But the sums of money which, by these troops, or on their account, are brought into, and expended in this State, are a great and local advantage. This can require no proof. If, at the conclusion of the war, for instance, our share of the Continental debt should be twenty millions of dollars, or say that we are called on to furnish an annual quota of two millions four hundred thousand dollars, to Congress, to be raised by tax, it is obvious that we should raise these given sums with greater or less ease, in proportion to the greater or less quantity of money found in circulation among us. I expect that our circulating money is [increased?], by the presence of these troops, at the rate of $30,000 a week, at the least. I have heard, indeed, that an objection arises to their being kept within this State, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>354<span class="bracket">]</span></span> from the information of the commissary that they cannot be subsisted here. In attending to the information of that officer, it should be borne in mind that the county of King William and its vicinities are one thing, the territory of Virginia another. If the troops could be fed upon long letters, I believe the gentleman at the head of that department in this country, would be the best commissary upon earth. But till I see him determined to act, not to write; to sacrifice his domestic ease to the duties of his appointment, and apply to the resources of this country, wheresoever they are to be had, I must entertain a different opinion of him. I am mistaken if, for the animal subsistence of the troops hitherto, we are not principally indebted to the genius and exertions of Hawkins, during the very short time he lived after his appointment to that department, by your board. His eye immediately pervaded the whole State, it was reduced at once to a regular machine, to a system, and the whole put into movement and animation by the fiat of a comprehensive mind. If the Commonwealth of Virginia cannot furnish these troops with bread, I would ask of the commissariat, which of the thirteen is now become the grain colony? If we are in danger of famine from the addition of four thousand mouths, what is become of that surplus of bread, the exportation of which used to feed the West Indies and Eastern States, and fill the colony with hard money? When I urge the sufficiency of this State, however, to subsist these troops, I beg to be understood, as having in contemplation the quantity of provisions necessary <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>355<span class="bracket">]</span></span> for their real use, and not as calculating what is to be lost by the wanton waste, mismanagement, and carelessness of those employed about it. If magazines of beef and pork are suffered to rot by slovenly butchering, or for want of timely provision and sale; if quantities of flour are exposed, by the commissaries entrusted with the keeping it, to pillage and destruction; and if, when laid up in the Continental stores, it is still to be embezzled and sold, the land of Egypt itself would be insufficient for their supply, and their removal would be necessary, not to a more plentiful country, but to more able and honest commissaries. Perhaps the magnitude of this question, and its relation to the whole State, may render it worth while to await the opinion of the National Council, which is now to meet within a few weeks. There is no danger of distress in the meantime, as the commissaries affirm they have a great sufficiency of provisions for some time to come. Should the measure of removing them into another State be adopted, and carried into execution, before the meeting of Assembly, no disapprobation of theirs will bring them back, because they will then be in the power of others, who will hardly give them up.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_831">Want of information as to what may be the precise measure proposed by the Governor and Council, obliges me to shift my ground, and take up the subject in every possible form. Perhaps, they have not thought to remove the troops out of this State altogether, but to some other part of it. Here, the objections arising from the expenses of removal, and of building new barracks, recur. As to animal food, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>356<span class="bracket">]</span></span> it may be driven to one part of the country as easily as to another: that circumstance, therefore, may be thrown out of the question. As to bread, I suppose they will require about forty or forty-five thousand bushels of grain a year. The place to which it is to be brought to them, is about the centre of the State. Besides, that the country round about is fertile, all the grain made in the counties adjacent to any kind of navigation, may be brought by water to within twelve miles of the spot. For these twelve miles, wagons must be employed; I suppose half a dozen will be a plenty. Perhaps, this part of the expense might have been saved, had the barracks been built on the water; but it is not sufficient to justify their being abandoned now they are built. Wagonage, indeed, seems to the commissariat an article not worth economizing. The most wanton and studied circuity of transportation has been practised: to mention only one act, they have bought quantities of flour for these troops in Cumberland, have ordered it to be wagoned down to Manchester, and wagoned thence up to the barracks. This fact happened to fall within my own knowledge. I doubt not there are many more such, in order either to produce their total removal, or to run up the expenses of the present situation, and satisfy Congress that the nearer they are brought to the commissary&#x2019;s own bed, the cheaper they will be subsisted. The grain made in the western counties may be brought partly in wagons, as conveniently to this as to any other place; perhaps more so, on account of its vicinity to one of the best passes through the Blue Ridge; and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>357<span class="bracket">]</span></span> partly by water, as it is near to James river, to the navigation of which, ten counties are adjacent above the falls. When I said that the grain might be brought hither from all the counties of the State adjacent to navigation, I did not mean to say it would be proper to bring it from all. On the contrary, I think the commissary should be instructed, after the next harvest, not to send one bushel of grain to the barracks from below the falls of the rivers, or from the northern counties. The counties on tide water are accessible to the calls for our own army. Their supplies ought, therefore, to be husbanded for them. The counties in the northwestern parts of the State are not only within reach for our own grand army, but peculiarly necessary for the support of Macintosh&#x2019;s army; or for the support of any other northwestern expedition, which the uncertain conduct of the Indians should render necessary; insomuch, that if the supplies of that quarter should be misapplied to any other purpose, it would destroy, in embryo, every exertion, either for particular or general safety there. The counties above tide water, in the middle and southern and western parts of the country, are not accessible to calls for either of those purposes, but at such an expense of transportation as the article would not bear. Here, then, is a great field, whose supplies of bread cannot be carried to our army, or rather, which will raise no supplies of bread, because there is nobody to eat them. Was it not, then, wise in Congress to remove to that field four thousand idle mouths, who must otherwise have interfered with the pasture of our <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>358<span class="bracket">]</span></span> own troops? And, if they are removed to any other part of the country, will it not defeat this wise purpose? The mills on the waters of James river, above the falls, open to canoe navigation, are very many. Some of them are of great note, as manufacturers. The barracks are surrounded by mills. There are five or six round about Charlottesville. Any two or three of the whole might, in the course of the winter, manufacture flour sufficient for the year. To say the worst, then, of this situation, it is but twelve miles wrong. The safe custody of these troops is another circumstance worthy consideration. Equally removed from the access of an eastern or western enemy; central to the whole State, so that should they attempt an irruption in any direction, they must pass through a great extent of hostile country; in a neighborhood thickly inhabited by a robust and hardy people zealous in the American cause, acquainted with the use of arms, and the defiles and passes by which they must issue: it would seem, that in this point of view, no place could have been better chosen.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_832">Their health is also of importance. I would not endeavor to show that their lives are valuable to us, because it would suppose a possibility, that humanity was kicked out of doors in America, and interest only attended to. The barracks occupy the top and brow of a very high hill, (you have been untruly told they were in a bottom.) They are free from bog, have four springs which seem to be plentiful, one within twenty yards of the piquet, two within fifty yards, and another within two hundred and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>359<span class="bracket">]</span></span> fifty, and they propose to sink wells within the piquet. Of four thousand people, it should be expected, according to the ordinary calcalutions, that one should die every day. Yet, in the space of near three months, there have been but four deaths among them; two infants under three weeks old, and two others by apoplexy. The officers tell me, the troops were never before so healthy since they were embodied.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_833">But is an enemy so execrable, that, though in captivity, his wishes and comforts are to be disregarded and even crossed? I think not. It is for the benefit of mankind to mitigate the horrors of war as much as possible. The practice, therefore, of modern nations, of treating captive enemies with politeness and generosity, is not only delightful in contemplation, but really interesting to all the world, friends, foes, and neutrals. Let us apply this: the officers, after considerable hardships, have all procured quarters, comfortable and satisfactory to them. In order to do this, they were obliged, in many instances, to hire houses for a year certain, and at such exorbitant rents, as were sufficient to tempt independent owners to go out of them, and shift as they could. These houses, in most cases, were much out of repair. They have repaired them at a considerable expense. One of the general officers has taken a place for two years, advanced the rent for the whole time, and been obliged, moreover, to erect additional buildings for the accommodation of part of his family, for which there was not room in the house rented. Independent of the brick work, for <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>360<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the carpentry of these additional buildings, I know he is to pay fifteen hundred dollars. The same gentleman, to my knowledge, has paid to one person three thousand six hundred and seventy dollars for different articles to fix himself commodiously. They have generally laid in their stocks of grain and other provisions, for it is well known that officers do not live on their rations. They have purchased cows, sheep, &amp;c., set in to farming, prepared their gardens, and have a prospect of comfort and quiet before them. To turn to the soldiers: the environs of the barracks are delightful, the ground cleared, laid off in hundreds of gardens, each enclosed in its separate paling; these well prepared, and exhibiting a fine appearance. General Riedezel alone laid out upwards of two hundred pounds in garden seeds for the German troops only. Judge what an extent of ground these seeds would cover. There is little doubt that their own gardens will furnish them a great abundance of vegetables through the year. Their poultry, pigeons and other preparations of that kind, present to the mind, the idea of a company of farmers, rather than a camp of soldiers. In addition to the barracks built for them by the public, and now very comfortable, they have built great numbers for themselves, in such messes as fancied each other; and the whole corps, both officers and men, seem now happy and satisfied with their situation. Having thus found the art of rendering captivity itself comfortable, and carried it into execution, at their own great expense and labor, their spirits sustained by the prospect of gratifications rising <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>361<span class="bracket">]</span></span> before their eyes, does not every sentiment of humanity revolt against the proposition of stripping them of all this, and removing them into new situations, where, from the advanced season of the year, no preparations can be made for carrying themselves comfortably through the heats of summer; and when it is known that the necessary advances for the conveniences already provided, have exhausted their funds and left them unable to make the like exertions anew. Again, review this matter, as it may regard appearances. A body of troops, after staying a twelvemonth at Boston, are ordered to take a march of seven hundred miles to Virginia, where, it is said, they may be plentifully subsisted. As soon as they are there, they are ordered on some other march, because, in Virginia, it is said, they cannot be subsisted. Indifferent nations will charge this either to ignorance, or to whim and caprice; the parties interested, to cruelty. They now view the proposition in that light, and it is said, there is a general and firm persuasion among them, that they were marched from Boston with no other purpose than to harass and destroy them with eternal marches. Perseverance in object, though not by the most direct way, is often more laudable than perpetual changes, as often as the object shifts light. A character of steadiness in our councils, is worth more than the subsistence of four thousand people.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_834">There could not have been a more unlucky concurrence of circumstances than when these troops first came. The barracks were unfinished for want of laborers, the spell of weather the worst ever <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>362<span class="bracket">]</span></span> known within the memory of man, no stores of bread laid in, the roads, by the weather and number of wagons, soon rendered impassable: not only the troops themselves were greatly disappointed, but the people in the neighborhood were alarmed at the consequences which a total failure of provisions might produce. In this worst state of things, their situation was seen by many and disseminated through the country, so as to occasion a general dissatisfaction, which even seized the minds of reasonable men, who, if not affected by the contagion, must have foreseen that the prospect must brighten, and that great advantages to the people must necessarily arise. It has, accordingly, so happened. The planters, being more generally sellers than buyers, have felt the benefit of their presence in the most vital part about them, their purses, and are now sensible of its source. I have too good an opinion of their love of order to believe that a removal of these troops would produce any irregular proofs of their disapprobation, but I am well assured it would be extremely odious to them.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_835">To conclude. The separation of these troops would be a breach of public faith, therefore I suppose it is impossible; if they are removed to another State, it is the fault of the commissaries; if they are removed to any other part of the State, it is the fault of the commissaries; and in both cases, the public interest and public security suffer, the comfortable and plentiful subsistence of our own army is lessened, the health of the troops neglected, their wishes crossed, and their comforts torn from them, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>363<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the character of whim and caprice, or, what is worse, of cruelty, fixed on us as a nation, and, to crown the whole, our own people disgusted with such a proceeding.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_836">I have thus taken the liberty of representing to you the facts and the reasons, which seem to militate against the separation or removal of these troops. I am sensible, however, that the same subject may appear to different persons, in very different lights. What I have urged as reasons, may, to sounder minds, be apparent fallacies. I hope they will appear, at least, so plausible, as to excuse the interposition of</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_838">&#x2014;Among the convention prisoners in this neighborhood is a Baron de Geismar of the Germans, brigade major to Genl. Gall, whose situation I would wish to make you acquainted with. He is the only son of a German nobleman, and has I believe an only sister; his father, now 70 years of age, if living; and excessively anxious to see him before his death. His Patrimonial expectations in danger of being transferred to others in the weak state of his father, or perhaps plundered in the case of his death; the footing on which he stands with <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>364<span class="bracket">]</span></span> his prince such as might give him reason to hope for protection were he on the spot, but everything of that kind certain of passing by him as long as he is absent. Under the circumstances, captivity is peculiarly injurious to him, &amp; he petitions Congress to exchange him if possible, or otherwise permit him to return home on any parole they will describe. I am satisfied he will carry with him no disposition to injure us; and his personal merit, with which I am become intimately acquainted, entitles him to every indulgence consistent with the indispensable rules of Congress. I take the liberty of recommending his request to your sollicitations, as from a knowledge of the man I am become interested in his happiness. Whatever you can do for him will be considered as a peculiar obligation on Dr. Sir, Your friend &amp; serv&#x2019;t.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_841">Whereas during the connection which subsisted between the now United States of America and the other parts of the British empire, &amp; their subjection to one common prince the inhabitants of either part had all the rights of natural born subjects in the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>366<span class="bracket">]</span></span> other, &amp; so might lawfully take &amp; hold real property, and transmit the same by descent to their heirs in fee simple, which could not be done by mere aliens; and the inhabitants on each part had accordingly acquired real property in the other: and in like manner had acquired personal property which by their common laws might be possessed by any other than an alien enemy &amp; transmitted to executors &amp; administrators: but when by the tyrannies of that prince, &amp; the open hostilities committed by his armies &amp; subjects inhabitants of the other parts of his dominions on the good people of the sd United States they are obliged to wage war in defense of their rights &amp; finally to separate themselves from the rest of the British empire, to renounce all subjection to their common prince, and to become sovereign &amp; independent states, the sd inhabitants of the other parts of the British empire become aliens &amp; enemies to the sd states, &amp; as such, incapable of holding the property real or personal so acquired therein &amp; so much thereof as was within this commonwealth became by the laws vested in the commonwealth.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_842">Nevertheless the General assembly, tho&#x2019; provoked by the example of their enemies to a departure from that generosity which so honourably distinguishes the civilized nations of the present age, yet desirous to conduct themselves with moderation &amp; temper, by an act passed at their session in the year 1777 took measures for preventing what had been the property of British subjects within this commonwealth from waste &amp; destruction, by putting the same <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>367<span class="bracket">]</span></span> into the hands &amp; under the management of commissioners appointed for that purpose, that so it might be in their power, if reasonable at a future day, to restore to the former proprietors the full value thereof:</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_843">And whereas it is found that the sd property is liable to be lost, wasted &amp; impaired without greater attention in the officers of government than is consistent with the discharge of their public duties and that from the advanced price at which the same would now sell, it may be most for the benefit of the former owners if the same should be restored to them hereafter, or to the public if not so restored, that the sale thereof should take place at this time, &amp; the proceeds be lodged in the public treasury.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_844">Be it therefore enacted by the General assembly that so much of the act before mentioned as may be supposed to have suspended the operation of the law of escheats &amp; forfeitures shall be hereby repealed &amp; that all the property, real &amp; personal within this commonwealth belonging at this time to any British subject, or which did belong to any British subject at the time such escheat or forfeiture may have taken place, shall be deemed to be vested in the commonwealth, the sd real estate by way of escheat &amp; the said personal estate by forfeiture.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_845">The Governor with the advice of council so far as their information will enable them, &amp; the commissioners of the tax within their several counties aided by their assessors shall forthwith institute proper proceedings of escheat &amp; forfeiture for all such <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>368<span class="bracket">]</span></span> property real &amp; personal in which they shall be advised and assisted by the several attornies for the commonwealth.</p>

Where the commissioners shall be of opinion that it will be more to the interest of the owner or public that possession of such property real or personal should be retained for finishing &amp; removing a crop or other purpose, it shall be lawful for them to stay the possession as it is now until the day of next, giving <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>370<span class="bracket">]</span></span> notice of such their intentions at the time of sale.</p>

I was comforted, however, with the reflection, that it was their competition, not ours, and that the difference of the numbers which decided between us, was too insignificant to give you a pain, or me a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>373<span class="bracket">]</span></span> pleasure, had our dispositions towards each other been such as to admit those sensations. I know you too well to need an apology for anything you do, and hope you will forever be assured of this; and as to the constructions of the world, they would only have added one to the many sins for which they are to go to the devil. As this is the first, I hope it will be the last, instance of ceremony between us. A desire to see my family, which is in Charles City, carries me thither to-morrow, and I shall not return till Monday. Mrs. Jefferson I believe will not come shortly to town. When she does however she has too much value for Mrs. Page not to consider her acquaintance as a principal among those circumstances which are to reconcile her to her situation. A knowledge of her sentiments on this subject renders it safe in undertaking that she shall do her part in cultivating a friendly intercourse. Be pleased to present my compliments to Mrs. Page, and add this to the assurances I have ever given you, that I am, dear Page, your affectionate friend.</p>

<div class="salute csc">Dear Fleming,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_853">&#x2014;I received your letter and have now to thank you for it. Some resolutions of Congress came to hand yesterday desiring an authentic state to be sent them of the cruelties said to have <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>374<span class="bracket">]</span></span> been committed by the enemy during their late invasion. The council had already taken measures to obtain such a state. Tho&#x2019; so near the scene where these barbarities are said to have been committed I am not able yet to decide within myself whether they were such or not. The testimony on both sides is such as if heard separately could not admit a moment&#x2019;s suspension of our faith.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_854">We have lately been extremely disturbed to find a pretty general opinion prevailing that peace and the independence of the thirteen states are now within our power, and that Congress have hesitations on the subject, and delay entering on the consideration. It has even been said that their conduct on this head has been so dissatisfactory to the French minister that he thinks of returning to his own country, ostensibly for better health, but in truth through disgust. Such an event would be deplored here as the most dreadful calamity. It is in contemplation of some gentlemen who conferred on the subject to propose the re-establishment of our committees of correspondence; others thought this too slow for the emergency and that plenipotentiary deputies should be sent to satisfy the mind of the French minister, and to set on foot proper measures for procuring the genuine sense of the several states. The whole however subsided on a supposition that the information might not be true, and that our delegates in Congress would think no obligations of secrecy under which they may have been laid sufficient to restrain them from informing their constituents of any proceedings which may involve the fate <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>375<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of their freedom and independence. It would surely be better to carry on a ten years&#x2019; war some time hence than to continue the present an unnecessary moment.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_855">Our land office I think will be opened; the sale of British property take place, and our tax bill put on a better footing. These measures I hope will put our finances into a better way and enable us to cooperate with our sister states in reducing the enormous sums of money in circulation. Every other remedy is nonsensical quackery. The house of delegates have passed a bill for removing the seat of government to Richmond. It hesitates with the Senate. We have established a board of war and a board of trade. I hear from your quarter that Genl. Sullivan is marching with a large army against the Indians. If he succeeds it will be the first instance of a great army doing anything against Indians and his laurels will be greater. We have ever found that chosen corps of men fit for the service of the woods, going against them with rapidity, and by surprize, have been most successful. I believe that our Colo. Clarke if we could properly reinforce him, would be more likely to succeed against those within his reach than Genl. Macintosh&#x2019;s regular method of proceeding. I shall hope to hear from you often. I put no name to this letter, because letters have miscarried, and if it goes safely you know the hand.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_856">&#x2014;Your letter to Governor Henry, of the 1st instant, came to hand yesterday, and I immediately laid it before the council. It gave them pain to hesitate on any request from General Phillips, whose polite conduct has disposed them to every indulgence consistent with the duties of their appointment. The indiscriminate murder of men, women and children, with the horrid circumstances of barbarity practised by the Indian savages, was the particular task of Governor Hamilton&#x2019;s employment; and if anything could have aggravated the acceptance of such an office, and have made him personally answerable in a high degree, it was that eager spirit with which he is said to have executed it, and which, if the representations before the council are to be credited, seems to have shown that his own feelings and disposition were in unison with his employment. The truth of these representations will be the subject of their inquiry shortly, and the treatment of Governor Hamilton will be mild or otherwise, as his conduct shall appear to merit, upon a more intimate examination. We trust it must furnish a contemplation highly pleasing to the generous soldier, to see honorable bravery respected, even by those against whom it happens to be enlisted, and discriminated from the cruel and cowardly warfare of the savage, whose object in war is to extinguish human nature.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>377<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_857">By a letter dated May 27th, you were desired to discharge the militia under your command as soon as you judged it proper; lest that letter should have miscarried, I now enclose you a copy. Colonel Finnie informs me he has written to you to apply for clothes at Winchester, for the use of your regiment of guards, and of the horse now with you. He yesterday showed me a letter from the continental board of war, giving the same directions; he says also that he had lately written to you on the subject of the articles desired for your particular use, and that he is not enabled to procure them more fully.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_858">As to putting the horse now with you on the same pay-roll with the regiment of guards, the council are of opinion that either your own powers are competent to it, or at least that it may be done in concert with the continental paymaster. The regiment of guards is recognized as continental; the duty they are jointly engaged in is continental; they therefore wish that this matter should go into the continental line altogether, rather than be controlled by their interference, where it is not absolutely necessary. I am your most obedient servant, &amp;c.</p>

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_859">&#x2014;I received your letter, and kind congratulations, for which I return you my thanks. In <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>378<span class="bracket">]</span></span> a virtuous government, and more especially in times like these, public offices are, what they should be, burthens to those appointed to them, which it would be wrong to decline, though foreseen to bring with them intense labour, and great private loss. I am, also, still to thank you for a former favour, enclosing a song and receipt. We have little new here. Colonel Clarke&#x2019;s expedition against St Vincents you know of; his prisoners are arrived at Chesterfield, and three of them brought to this place to be severely dealt with; the enclosed paper will explain that matter. We have 300 men, under Colonel Bowman, in the Shawnee county, of whom we hope to receive good accounts: the destruction of the villages of the Cherokees, at Chuchamogga, and taking their goods, &amp;c., has brought them to sue for peace; but the happiest stroke was the burning twenty-thousand bushels of corn, collected there for the use of the expeditions, which were to have been adopted at the great council. Governor Hamilton had called at the mouth of the Tanissee, as mentioned in the within paper. It is a cruel thought, that, when we feel ourselves standing on the firmest ground, in every respect, the cursed art of our secret enemies, combining with other causes, should effect, by depreciating our money, what the open arms of a powerful enemy could not. What is to be done? Taxation is become of no account, for it is foreseen, that, notwithstanding its increased amount, there will still be a greater deficiency than ever. I own I see no assured hope, but in peace, or a plentiful loan of hard money.</p>

I never was a punctual correspondent to any person, as I must own to my shame; perhaps my present office will put it more out of my power; however as it may sometimes furnish me with matter which may induce me to hope my letters may be worth sending, I may venture to say, you shall hear from me whenever I can get over the twofold difficulty of many letters of absolute necessity, to write, and an innate aversion to that kind of business.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_861">&#x2014;Yours of the 14th instant came to hand this day. * * * With respect to Col.

His assurances to us are fair; one thing only I am to inform you, that however true it may be that he is without money, it is no just excuse for failing to do anything for the public service, because that was never permitted by the executive here, to be on sufferance for want of money. He never applied in vain, and we still are, as we ever have been, ready to lend him (as a continental officer) any monies, which the due discharge of his office may call [for] * * * and politeness at the [least] hardly permits <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>380<span class="bracket">]</span></span> them to suppose the duties of the [post can be as] well discharged by any other, as by yourself.

I enclose you the reasons, which have induced the council to [act] with such rigor with Governor Hamilton and the others there. It is impossible for any generous man to disapprove his sentence.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_862">In 1776, as Jefferson states in his <span class="ital">Autobiography,</span> (i., 66), he introduced a bill in the General Assembly, creating a committee to revise and codify the laws of the state. The committee, consisting of Jefferson, Pendleton, Wythe, George Mason, and Thomas L. Lee, met at Fredericksburg, Jan. 13, 1777, and outlined a plan (partly printed in Rowland&#x2019;s <span class="ital">Life of Mason,</span> i., 276) settling certain details, and apportioning the work among the revisors. Both Mason and Lee resigned before the code was fairly commenced; but the remaining three worked on the revisal for over two years, finally meeting again at Williamsburg in Feb., 1779, where, Jefferson states (<span class="ital">Autobiography</span>), they &#x201C;examined critically our several parts, sentence by sentence, scrutinizing and amending until we had agreed on the whole. We then returned home, [and] had fair copies made of our several parts.&#x201D; A letter of Pendleton, however, gives a different version of this (<span class="ital">Pendleton to Jefferson,</span> May 11, 1779):</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_863">&#x201C;I immediately wrote to our friend W. to be informed if anything had happen&#x2019;d, or passed between you &amp; him, which made it necessary for me to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>384<span class="bracket">]</span></span> attend further to the work of Revisal, contrary to what had been agreed to between Us, that you should settle our diversity of Opinions upon the Bills he had prepared, as well as mine, which he chose to consider by himself, &amp; Point out for your Examination any alterations he judged proper, &amp; then they were to be fairly transcribed as well as yours, which we had before gone through &amp; reported. I let him know that I was ready to attend him at any time, if such Occurrences had made it necessary; he answered that no Alteration was made in that plan &amp; I was satisfied.&#x201D;</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_864">Finally they reported the results of their work to the Assembly in the following letter:</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_865">&#x2014;The committee appointed in pursuance of an act of General Assembly, passed in 1776 intituled &#x201C;An act for the revision of the laws,&#x201D; have according to the requisitions of the said act, gone through that work, and prepared 126 bills, the titles of which are stated in the enclosed catalogue. Some of these bills have been presented to the House of Delegates in the course of the present session, two or three of them delivered to members of that House at their request to be presented, the rest are in the two bundles which accompany this; these we take the liberty through you of presenting to the General Assembly.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_866">In the course of this work we were unfortunately deprived of the assistance and abilities of our associates <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>385<span class="bracket">]</span></span> appointed by the General Assembly, of the one by death, of the other by resignation. As the plan of the work had been settled, and agreeable to that plan it was in a considerable degree carried into execution before that loss, we did not exercise the powers given us by the act, of filling up the places by new appointment, being desirous that the plan agreed on by members who were specially appointed by the Assembly, might not be liable to alteration from others who might not equally possess their confidence, it has therefore been executed by the three remaining members, one of whom being prevented from putting his signature hereto, by the great distance of his residence from this city, has by letter authorized us to declare his concurrence in the report.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_868">For some reason the Assembly neglected the <span class="ital">Report of the Revisors</span> for some years; but finally, in 1784, Madison succeeded in getting 500 copies of it printed, and at the sessions of 1785 and 1786, fifty-six out of the one hundred and twenty-six bills, which constituted the collection, were, after amendment, made laws (see <span class="ital">Hening,</span> xii.).</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_869">The part assigned to Jefferson in this work was &#x201C;to undertake the first part (&#x2018;the first period in the division of the statutes to end with 25th, H. 8th&#x2019;) with the law of descents.&#x201D;</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>386<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_870">After consideration, the editor has concluded to print only the most notable of the bills Jefferson drafted for this Revisal, as many are of a merely formal and routine character, and he himself wrote of the collection (to <span class="ital">Hogendorp,</span> Oct. 13, 1785):</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_871">&#x201C;If you had formed any considerable expectations from our revised code of laws you will be much disappointed. It contains not more than three or four laws which could strike the attention of a foreigner. Had it been a digest of all our laws, it would not have been comprehensible or instructive but to a native. But it is still less so, as it digests only the British statutes &amp; our own acts of assembly, which are but a supplementary part of our law. The great basis of it is anterior to the date of the Magna charta, which is the oldest statute extant. The only merit of this work is that it may remove from our book shelves about twenty folio volumes of our statutes, retaining all the parts of them which either their own merit or the established system of our laws required.&#x201D;</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_952">&#x2014;I have the pleasure to enclose you the particulars of Colo. Clarke&#x2019;s success against St. Vincenne as stated in his letter but lately received, the messenger with his first letter having been killed.<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_320" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_320_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> I fear it will be impossible for Colo. Clarke to be so strengthened as to enable him to do what he desires. Indeed the express who brought this letter gives us reason to fear St. Vincenne is in danger from a large body of Indians collected to attack it and said when he came from Kaskaskias to be within 30 leagues of the place. I also enclose you a letter from Colo. Shelby stating the effect of his success against the seceding Cherokees and Chuccamogga. The damage done them was killing half a dozen, burning 11 Towns, 20,000 bushels of Corn collected probably to forward the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>446<span class="bracket">]</span></span> expeditions which were to have been planned at the Council which was to meet Governor Hamilton at the mouth of Tenissee, and taking as many goods as sold for &#xA3;25,000. I hope these two blows coming together and the depriving them of their head will in some measure effect the quiet of our frontiers this summer. We have intelligence also that Colo. Bowman from Kentucky is in the midst of the Shawnee county with 300 men &amp; hope to hear a good account of him. The enclosed order being in its nature important and generally interesting, I think it proper to transmit it to you with the reasons supporting it. It will add much to our satisfaction to know it meets your approbation.<a href="#lf0054-02_footnote_nt_321" id="lf0054-02_footnote_nt_321_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_954">P. S. The distance of our northern and western counties from the scene of Southern service and the necessity of strengthening our Western quarter have induced the Council to direct the new levies from the Counties of Yohogania, Ohio, Monongalia, Frederick Hampshire, Berkley, Rockingham and Greenbrier amounting to somewhat less than 300 men to enter into the 9th Regiment at Pittsburg. The aid they may give there will be so immediate &amp; important and what they could do to the Southward would be so late as I hope will apologise for their interference.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_956">&#x2014;Our delegates by the last post informed us that we might now obtain blank letters of marque for want of which our people have long &amp; exceedingly suffered. I have taken the liberty therefore of desiring them to apply for fifty, &amp; transmit them by a safe conveyance.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_957">The inclosed order being in it&#x2019;s nature important and generally interesting, I thought it my duty to lay it before Congress as early as possible, with the reasons supporting it; nothing doubting but it will meet with their approbation; it&#x2019;s justice seems to have been confirmed by the general sense of the people here.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_958">Before the receipt of your letter desiring a state to be made out of the ravages &amp; enormities unjustifiable by the usage of civilized nations committed by the enemy on their late invasion near Portsmouth, I had taken measures for the same purpose meaning to transmit them to you. They are not yet returned to me. I have given the same orders with respect to their still later proceedings in the county of Northumberland.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_959">Our trade has never been so distressed since the time of Lord Dunmore as it is at present by a parcel of trifling privateers under the countenance of two or three larger vessels who keep our little naval force from doing anything. The uniform train of events which during the whole course of this war we are to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>448<span class="bracket">]</span></span> suppose has rendered it improper that the American fleet or any part of it should ever come to relieve or countenance the trade of certain places, while the same train of events has as uniformly rendered it proper to confine them to the protection of certain other parts of the continent is a lamentable arrangement of fortune for us. The same ill luck has attended us as to the disposition of the prizes taken by our navy, which tho&#x2019; sometimes taken just off our capes, it has always been expedient to carry elsewhere. A British prize would be a more rare phenomenon here than a comet, because the one has been seen, but the other never was. * * *</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_965">&#x2014;Your kind letter of June 19 I received on the 2d inst. It is now some time since Colo. Bland wrote for leave to grant Permits to capt. Bartling &amp; Lt. Campbell to come to the Argyle flag. Leave was immediately given by letter to Col. Bland. Sometime after I received another letter from him, accompanied with one from General Phillips informing me that Lt. Campbell was come as far as Richmond, &amp; waited for a permit to proceed. A permit was instantly made out and dispatched. Capt. Bartling was not mentioned on that occasion &amp; therefore no permit was made out for him. The 3d inst. was fixed for Lt. Campbell to be at the flag to do his business, and it was only on the day before that your letter came to me by post. I shall instantly write to capt. Bartling giving him license to proceed, if his business remains still to be done, by a conveyance which occurs tomorrow. I thought it necessary to give you this detail of circumstances that any delays which may happen might be ascribed to those accidents which may have caused them.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_966">I thank you for your kind congratulations; tho&#x2019; condolations would be better suited to the occasion not only on account of the labours of the office to which I am called, and its withdrawing me from retirement, but also the loss of the agreeable society I have left of which Mad&#x2019;me de Riedesel and yourself <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>452<span class="bracket">]</span></span> were an important part.

We fear that this excursion, necessary for your amusement to diversify the scenes of discomfort, may deprive us of the pleasure of seeing you when we come to Monticello the last of this month. We shall stay there about a month. Mrs. Jefferson joins me in compliments to yourself &amp; Mad&#x2019;me de Riedesel, I shall be able to execute her commission as to the spoons and bring them up with me.</p>

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_968">&#x2014;I some time ago enclosed to you a printed Copy of an order of Council, by which Governor Hamilton was to be confined in Irons in close Jail. This has occasioned a letter from General Phillips of which the inclosed is a Copy. The General seems to suppose that a prisoner on capitulation cannot be put into close confinement tho&#x2019; his Capitulation shall not have provided against it. My idea was that all persons taken in war were to be deemed prisoners of war. That those who surrender on capitulation (or convention) are prisoners of war also, subject to the same treatment with those who surrender at discretion, except only so far as the terms of their capitulation or convention shall have guarded them. In the Capitulation of Governor Hamilton (a Copy of which <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>453<span class="bracket">]</span></span> I inclose) no stipulation is made as to the treatment of himself or those taken with him. The Governor, indeed when he signs, adds a flourish of reasons inducing him to capitulate, one of which is the generosity of his Enemy. Generosity on a large and comprehensive Scale seems to dictate the making a signal example of this gentleman; but waiving that, these are only private motives inducing him to surrender, and do not enter into the Contract of Colonel Clarke. I have the highest idea of the sacredness of those Contracts which take place between nation and nation at war, and would be the last on earth who should do anything in violation of them. I can find nothing in those Books usually recurred to as testimonials of the Laws &amp; usages of nature and nations which convicts the opinions, I have above expressed, of error. Yet there may be such an usage as General Phillips seems to suppose, tho&#x2019; not taken notice of by these writers. I am obliged to trouble your Excellency on this occasion, by asking of you information on this point. There is no other person whose decision will so authoritatively decide this point in the public mind, and none with which I am disposed so implicitly to comply. If you shall be of opinion that the bare existence of a Capitulation in the case of Governor Hamilton privileges him from confinement, tho&#x2019; there be no article to that Effect in the capitulation, justice shall most assuredly be done him. The importance of this question in a public view, &amp; my own anxiety under a charge of violation of national faith by the Executive of this Commonwealth will I hope apologise for <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>454<span class="bracket">]</span></span> my adding this to the many, many troubles with which I know you to be burthened.

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_970">P. S. I have just received a Letter from Colo. Bland containing information of numerous desertions from the Convention Troops (not less than 400 in the last fortnight). He thinks he has reason to believe it is with the connivance of some of their officers. Some of these have been taken, all of them going northwardly. They had armed themselves with forged passports, and with Certificates of having taken the oath of fidelity to the State; some of them forged, others really given by weak magistrates. I mention this to your Excellency as perhaps it may be in your power to have such of them intercepted as shall be passing through Pennsylvania &amp; Jersey.</p>

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_973">&#x2014;Your letter on the subject of Lieutenant Governor Hamilton&#x2019;s confinement came safely to hand. I shall with great cheerfulness explain to you the reasons on which the advice of Council was founded, since after the satisfaction of doing what is <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>455<span class="bracket">]</span></span> right, the greatest is that of having what we do approved by those whose opinions deserve esteem.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_974">We think ourselves justified in Governor Hamilton&#x2019;s strict confinement on the general principle of National retaliation. To state to you the particular facts of British cruelty to American prisoners, would be to give a melancholy history from the capture of Colo. Ethan Allen, at the beginning of the war to the present day, a history which I will avoid, as equally disagreeable to you and to me. I with pleasure do you the justice to say that I believe these facts to be very many unknown to you, as Canada has been the only scene of your service in America, and, in that quarter, we have reason to believe that Sir Guy Carleton, and the three officers commanding there, have treated our prisoners (since the instance of Colo. Allen) with considerable lenity. What has been done in England, and what in New York &amp; Philadelphia, you are probably uninformed; as it would hardly be made the subject of epistolary correspondence. I will only observe to you, Sir, that the confinement and treatment of our officers, soldiers and seamen, have been so rigorous and cruel, as that a very great portion of the whole of those captured in the course of this war, &amp; carried to Philadelphia while in possession of the British army and to New York, have perished miserably from that cause only; and that this fact is as well established with us, as any historical fact which has happened in the course of the war. A Gentleman of this Commonwealth in public office, and of known and established character, who was taken on the sea, carried to New York and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>456<span class="bracket">]</span></span> exchanged, has given us lately a particular information of the treatment of our prisoners there. Officers taken by land, it seems, are permitted to go on parole within certain limits of Long Island, till suggestions shall be made to their prejudice by some Tory refugee, or other equally worthless person, when they are hurried to the Provot in New York, without enquiring &#x201C;whether they be founded upon positive facts, be matter of hearsay, or taken from the reports of interested men.&#x201D; The example of enquiring into the truth of charges of this nature according to legal principles of evidence, has surely not been set us by our enemies. We enquired what these Provots were and were told they were the common miserable jails, built for the confinement of malefactors. Officers and men taken by sea were kept in prison ships infe[sted] with [ ] ught on by the crowd [<span class="ital">Parts of one line and all of another at bottom of the page lacking</span>] from five to ten a day. When therefore we are desired to the possible consequence of treating prisoners with rigour, I need only ask when did those rigours begin? not with us assuredly. I think you, Sir, who have had as good opportunities as any British officer of learning in what manner we treat those whom the fortune of war has put in our hands can clear us from the charge of rigour as far as your knowledge or information has extended. I can assert that Governor Hamilton&#x2019;s is the first instance which has occurred in my own country, and, if there has been another in any of the United States, it is unknown to me; these instances must have been extremely rare, if they have ever <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>457<span class="bracket">]</span></span> existed at all, or they could not have been altogether unheard of by me, when a uniform exercise of kindness to prisoners on our part has been returned by as uniform severity on the part of our enemies. You must excuse me for saying it is high time, by other lessons, to teach respect to the dictates of humanity, in such a case retaliation becomes an act of humanity.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_975">But suppose, Sir, we were willing still longer to decline the drudgery of general retaliation, yet Governor Hamilton&#x2019;s conduct has been such as to call for exemplary punishment on him personally. In saying this I have not so much in view his particular cruelties to our Citizens, prisoners with him (which tho&#x2019; they have been great, were of necessity confined to a small scale) as the general nature of the service he undertook at Detroit and the extensive exercise of cruelties which they involved. Those who act together in war are answerable for each other. No distinction can be made between principal and ally by those against whom the war is waged. He who employs another to do a deed makes the deed his own. If he calls in the hand of the assassin or murderer, himself becomes the assassin or murderer. The known rule of warfare of the Indian Savages is an indiscriminate butchery of men, women &amp; children. These savages, under this well known character, are employed by the British Nation as allies in the war against the Americans. Governor Hamilton undertakes to be the conductor of the war. In the execution of that undertaking, he associates small parties of the whites under his immediate command with large parties of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>458<span class="bracket">]</span></span> savages, and sends them to act, sometimes jointly, and sometimes separately, not against our forts or Armies in the Field, but the farming settlements on our frontiers. Governor Hamilton is himself the butcher of men, women &amp; children. I will not say to what length the fair rules of war would extend the right of punishment against him; but I am sure that confinement under its strictest circumstances, for Indian devastation and massacre must be deemed lenity. I apprehend you had not sufficiently adverted to the expression in the advice of the Council when you suppose the proclamation there alluded to, to be the one addressed to the Inhabitants of the Illinois afterwards printed in the public papers &amp; to be affirmed to contain &#x2019;denun [<span class="ital">Two lines at bottom of page gone.</span>] ians&#x2019; Proclamation, there alluded to, contained nothing more than an invitation to our officers and soldiers to join British arms against those whom he is pleased to call Rebels and Traitors. In order to introduce these among our people, they were put into the hands of the Indians; and in every house, where they murdered or carried away the family, they left one of these proclamations, some of them were found sticking on the breasts of the persons murdered, one under the hand &amp; seal of Governor Hamilton came to our hands. The Indians being the bearers of proclamations under the hand and seal of Governor Hamilton (no matter what was the subject of them) there can be no doubt they were acting under his direction, and, as including this proof, the fact was cited in the advice of the Council. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>459<span class="bracket">]</span></span> But if you will be so good as to recur to the address of the Illinois, which you refer to, you will find that, tho&#x2019; it does not in express terms threaten vengeance, blood &amp; massacre, yet it proves that the Governor had made for us the most ample provision of all these Calamities. He there gives in detail the horrid catalogue of savage nations, extending from South to North whom he had leagued with himself to wage combined war on our frontiers; and it is well known that that war would of course be made up of blood and general Massacres of men, women and children. Other papers of Governor Hamilton&#x2019;s have come to our hands containing instructions to officers going out with scalping parties of Indians &amp; Whites, and proving that kind of war was waged under his express orders; further proofs in abundance might be adduced, but I suppose the fact is too notorious to need them.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_976">Your letter seems to admit an inference that, whatever may have been the general conduct of our enemies towards their prisoners, or whatever the personal conduct of Governor Hamilton, yet, as a prisoner by capitulation, you consider him as privileged from strict confinement. I do not pretend to an intimate knowledge of this subject. My idea is that the term &#x201C;prisoners of war&#x201D; is a generic one, the specification of which is&#x2014;1st Prisoner at discretion; &amp; 2d prisoners on convention or capitulation. Thus in the debate of the house of Commons of the 27th November last, on the address, the minister, speaking of General Burgoyne (and in his presence) says he is &#x201C;a prisoner,&#x201D; and General Burgoyne calls himself &#x201C;a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>460<span class="bracket">]</span></span> prisoner under the terms of the Convention of Saratoga,&#x201D; intimating that tho&#x2019; a prisoner, he is a prisoner of a particular species entitled to certain terms. The treatment of the first class ought to be such as to be approved by the usage of polished nations; gentle and humain unless a contrary conduct in an enemy or individual, render a stricter treatment necessary. The prisoners of the 2d Class have nothing to exempt them from a like treatment with those of the first except so far as they shall have been able to make better terms by articles of Capitulation. So far then as these shall have provided for an exemption from strict treatment so prisoners on Capitulation have a right to be distinguished from those at discretion. [<span class="ital">Two lines at bottom of the page gone.</span>] certain causes antecedent thereto, tho&#x2019; such instances might be produced, from English history too, and in one case where the King himself commanded in person. Marshal Boufflers after the taking of the castle Namur was arrested and detained prisoner of war by King William tho&#x2019; by an article of capitulation it was stipulated that the officers and soldiers of the garrison in general, and Marshal Boufflers by name should be at Liberty. However we waive reasoning on this head because no article in the Capitulation of Governor Hamilton is violated by his confinement. Perhaps not having seen the Capitulation, you were led to suppose it a thing of course that being able to obtain terms of surrender, they would first provide for their own treatment. I enclose you a copy of the Capitulation, by which you will see that 2d Article declares them prisoners of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>461<span class="bracket">]</span></span> war; and nothing is said as to the treatment they were to be entitled to. When Governor Hamilton signs indeed he adds a flourish, containing the motives inducing him to capitulate, one of which was confidence in a generous enemy. He should have reflected that generosity on a large scale would take side against him. However these were only his private motives and did not enter into the contract with Colo. Clarke. Being prisoners of war then, with only such privileges as their Capitulation had provided, and that having provided nothing on the subject of their treatment, they are liable to be treated as other prisoners. We have not extended our order, as we might justifiably have done to the whole of this corps. Governor Hamilton &amp; Capn. Lamothe alone, as leading offenders, are in confinement. The other officers and men are treated as if they had been taken in justifiable war; the officers being at large on their parole, and the men also having their liberty to a certain extent. Dejean was not included in the Capitulation, being taken 8 days after on the Wabache 150 miles from St. Vincennes.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_977">I hope, Sir, that being made more fully acquainted with the facts on which the advice of Council was grounded, and exercising your own good sense in cool and candid deliberation on these facts, and the consequences deducible from them according to the usages and sentiments of civilized nations, you will see the transaction in a very different light from that in which it appeared at the time of writing your Letter, and ascribe the advice of the Council, not to want of attention to the sacred nature of public <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>462<span class="bracket">]</span></span> conventions, of which I hope we shall never, in any circumstances, lose sight, but to a desire of stopping the effusion of ye unoffending blood of women and children, and the unjustifiable severities exercised on our captive officers and soldiers in general, by proper severities on our part.

Mathews arrived on parole from New York by the way of headquarters bringing your Excellency&#x2019;s letter on his subject, with that of the British commissary of prisoners. The subject is of great importance &amp; I must therefore reserve myself to answer after further consideration. Were I to speak from present impressions I should say it was happy for Governor Hamilton that a final determination of his fate was formed before this new information. As the enemy have released Capt. Willing from his irons the Executive of this State will be induced perhaps not to alter their former opinion. But it is impossible they can be serious in attempting to bully us in this manner. We have too many of their subjects in our power &amp; too much iron to clothe them with &amp; I will add too much resolution to avail ourselves of both to fear their pretended retaliation. However I will do myself the honor of forwarding to your Excellency the ultimate result of council on this subject.</p>

</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_991">&#x2014;The proceedings respecting Governor Hamilton &amp; his companions previous to your arrival here, you are acquainted with. For your more precise information, I enclose you the advice of Council of June the 16th, of that of August the 28th, another of Sep. 19th, of the parole tendered them the 1st instant and of Governor Hamilton&#x2019;s letter of the same day stating his objections in which he persevered: from that time his confinement has become a voluntary one. You delivered us your letters the next day when the post being just setting out much business prevented the Council from taking them into consideration. They have this day attended to them and found their resolution expressed in the enclosed advice bearing date this day. It gives us great pain that any of our countrymen should be cut off from <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>468<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the society of their friends &amp; tenderest connections while it seems as if it was in our power to administer relief. But we trust to their good sense for discerning &amp; their spirit for bearing up against the fallacy of this appearance. Governor Hamilton and his companions were imprisoned &amp; ironed. 1st. In retaliation for cruel treatment of our captive citizens by the enemy in general. 2d. For the barbarous species of warfare which himself &amp; his savage allies carried on in our western frontier. 3d. For particular acts of barbarity of which he himself was personally guilty to some of our citizens in his power. Any one of these charges was sufficient to justify the measures we took. Of the truth of the first yourselves are witnesses. Your situation indeed seems to have been better since you were sent to New York, but reflect on what you suffered before that &amp; knew others of your countrymen to suffer &amp; what you know is now suffered by that more unhappy part of them who are still confined on board the prison ships of the enemy. Proofs of the second charge we have under Hamilton&#x2019;s own hand: And of the third as sacred assurances as human testimony is capable of giving. Humane conduct on our part was found to produce no effect: the contrary therefore was to be tried: If it produces a proper lenity to our citizens in captivity it will have the effect we meant: if it does not we shall return a severity as terrible as universal. If the causes or our rigour against Hamilton were founded in truth that rigour was just &amp; would not give right to the Enemy to commence any new hostilities on their part; and all such new severities are to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>469<span class="bracket">]</span></span> be considered, not as retaliation but as original and unprovoked. If those causes were not founded in truth they should have denied them. If declining the tribunal of truth &amp; reason they chuse to pervert this into a contest of cruelty and destruction we will contend with them in that line, &amp; measure out misery to those in our power in that multiplied proportion which the advantage of superior numbers enables us to do. We shall think it our particular duty after the information we gather from the papers which have been laid before us to pay very constant attention to your situation &amp; that of your fellow prisoners. We hope that the prudence of the Enemy will be your protection from injury, &amp; we are assured that your regard for the honour of your country would not permit you to wish we should suffer ourselves to be bullied into an acquiescence under every insult &amp; cruelty they may chuse to practice, &amp; a fear to retaliate lest you should be made to experience additional sufferings. Their officers &amp; soldiers in our hands are pledges for your safety: we are determined to use them as such. Iron will be retaliated by iron but a great multiplication on distinguished objects; prison ships by prison ships, and like for like in general. I do not mean by this to cover any officer who has acted or shall act improperly. They say Capt. Willing was guilty of great cruelties at the Natches: if so they do right in punishing him. I would use any powers I have for the punishment of any officer of our own who should be guilty of excesses unjustifiable under the usages of civilized nations. However I do not find myself <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>470<span class="bracket">]</span></span> obliged to believe the charge against Capt. Willing to be true on the affirmation of the British commissary because in the next breath he affirms no cruelties have as yet been inflicted on him. Capt. Willing has been in irons.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_992">I beg you to be assured there is nothing consistent with the honor of your country which we shall not at all times be ready to do for the relief of yourself &amp; companions in captivity. We know that ardent spirit and hatred for tyranny which brought you into your present situation will enable you to bear up against it with the firmness which has distinguished you as a soldier, and to look forward with pleasure to the day when events shall take place against which the wounded spirits of your Enemies will find no comfort even from reflections on the most refined of the cruelties with which they have glutted themselves.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_994">&#x2014;Since the date of my former letter to you, I have recd. the inclosed resolutions of Congress containing a requisition of additional supplies of money. The General Assembly in considering this subject will naturally cast their eyes on the funds already provided for the Supply of their public treasury. As a principal branch of these was in some degree under the care and direction of the executive, I mean the proceeds of the estates of British subjects, it becomes <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>471<span class="bracket">]</span></span> my duty to guard the assembly against relying in their calculations for any great &amp; immediate supplies from hence. Facts have come to our notice which give great reason to believe that the transverse &amp; other pleadings justly allowed by the law for saving the rights of those who have real or probable appearance of right is perverted to frustrate or delay its effects, by being put in on grounds either frivolous or false and by that means throwing the subject into a course of legal contestation which under the load of business now on the docquet of the general Court, may not be terminated in the present age. In one instance we are certified by the clerk of the general Court that the estate is claimed by the steward; tho&#x2019; this very man undertook to act as Commissioner of the estate under the sequestration law by our appointment, and has himself personally rendered annual accounts to us of the proceeds of the estate as the estate of a British subject. Yet his claim palpably false as it is, in order to obtain the ceremony of being adjudged so, is to go through all the formalities of regular litigation before the estate can be exposed to sale. Perhaps the aids expected from this law might still be obtained however, and as perfect justice done to every individual by a legislative provision for determining these pleadings in a speedy way. I thought it my duty to guard the general assembly against any deception in their expectations from these funds, that no disappointments may accrue in the measures they shall be pleased to adopt.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_995">While on the subject of Continental demands for supplies from this State I am to inform you, sir, of an <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>472<span class="bracket">]</span></span> unfortunate delay in the settlement of the Continental accounts. Immediately on the rising of the general assembly the Executive proceeded without intermission to put into a course of execution the several things made incumbent on them, it was the 17th July before, according to their arrangements, they could proceed to appoint a Commissioner to settle the Continental account. They then appointed a gentleman fully qualified in every point of view to discharge this duty perfectly. His first letter, dated three days after the appointment, gave reason to hope he would undertake the charge. Ill health however and other subsequent circumstances obliged him to decline, and the letter notifying that did not come to hand till the 10th of the last month. Since this no person has been found competent to the business &amp; willing to undertake it. We are in hopes that the more extensive acquaintance of the members of General assembly may enable them to appoint a person equal to this very difficult business.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_996">A book of military institutions written by Major General Steuben and recommended for general use by Congress has been transmitted to me. I take the liberty of depositing it with the general assembly as on future revisions of their militia laws they may be able perhaps to extract some useful matters from it. Or it may be thought worth printing &amp; dispersing among the officers of y<span class="sup">e</span> militia.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_998">&#x2014;The Executive in the Month of March 1778, in order to secure the acquisition &amp; proper choice of a supply of Arms, Ordnance &amp; Military implements sent a Mr. Le Mair of the Kingdom of France their Agent express for that purpose to Europe. He executed his commission with a zeal and assiduity which we have rarely met with, having traversed for fourteen months those parts of Europe backwards &amp; forwards where there was a hope of getting the articles wanted, and after eighteen months&#x2019; absence returned himself in the last of three Vessels which he charged with ordnance and other necessities. His reasonable expenses we mean to pay and were about making him a proper pecuniary compensation for his time and great labour but he prays rather to be rewarded with military rank unattended by either pay or command; expecting to reap greater benefit from this in his own Country to which he is about to return. The Executive apprehending they have no authority to grant brevet commissions, refer to the general assembly the expedience of authorizing them to give to this gentleman a Lieutenant Colonel&#x2019;s commission by way of brevet. They shall not indeed then think themselves discharged from making him some pecuniary compensation tho&#x2019; a much smaller may be given than they had before proposed.</p>

<div class="dateline"><span class="csc">In Council</span>, <div class="date 1779-10-30">Oct. 30th, 1779</div>.</div>
<div class="salute csc">Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1000">&#x2014;In pursuance of a resolution of the last session of General assembly the Executive proceeded to form a contract with Messrs. Penet Windel &amp; Co. for the establishment of a manufactury of fire arms &amp; foundery of ordnance on James river and for extending navigation through its falls. The several preliminary papers which passed between them are now transmitted to the general assembly that they may be enabled to judge of the obstacles the executive had to encounter, and to see the reasons explained which led them to the several conclusions. These articles also, as ultimately concluded, accompany this, together with a subsequent letter from Mr. Penet and memorial from Mr. Savarit desiring some alterations in two of the articles.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1001">The several objects of this contract must be admitted of the last importance: The depending on the transportation of arms across an element on which our enemies have reigned, for the defence of our own country, has been already found insecure &amp; distressing. The endeavours of five years aided with some internal manufacturers have not yet found a tolerable supply of arms. To make them within ourselves then as well as the other implements of war, is as necessary as to make our bread within ourselves. The present contract seems really to afford a promising appearance of future supply. Should these articles meet with ratification from the general <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>475<span class="bracket">]</span></span> assembly, I must still inform them that obstacles are likely to arise, of a very perplexing nature, from an unlucky connection of the public with a certain Mr. Ballendine who has entangled himself into every part of the subjects of this contract. Some of his rights are real; some only pretended. Unless they can be cleared away by legislation in a speedy mode, liberal compensation being first allowed him for such of them as shall be found just, the length of time which would be required to follow him through Courts of Justice in the ordinary course of proceedings, will defeat every hope which might be entertained from this Contract. The duty imposed upon the executive by the resolution of assembly led them necessarily to an investigation of this man&#x2019;s rights &amp; pretensions. That the assembly may have proper lights to conduct their enquiries I will analyse his claims as they have appeared to us. They refer to three several subjects, which I will endeavour to keep distinct, to avoid that confusion they might otherwise throw on one another. 1. To the furnace in Buckingham. 2. To the Foundary at Westham. 3. To the construction of a navigable Canal at the falls of James river.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1002">1. Mr. Ballendine with a partner Mr. Reveley received by order from the assembly &#xA3;5000 in the year 1776 for the purpose of erecting a furnace in Buckingham &amp; stipulated to repay it in pigiron at seven pounds ten shillings the ton, which in fact amounted to a contract to pay the public 666&#x2154; tons of pigiron. In December 1777 he received a further sum of &#xA3;2500. In May 1778 he petitioned the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>476<span class="bracket">]</span></span> assembly to release him from the obligation of paying his Debt in iron at &#xA3;7.10/ the ton, and to take it at the Market price at the time of delivery of the iron, the assembly agreed that he should be allowed more than &#xA3;7,10. but not the market price at the <span class="ital">time of delivery,</span> thus signifying their sense that there was some intermediate ground on which they meant to take their stand, but not pointing out what that was. This led us to suppose that the Market price of iron at the time of the <span class="ital">paiment of the money</span> to Ballendine might be what the assembly had probably in view. On settlement of his several accounts with the Commissioners whom we appointed according to the resolution of assembly for that purpose &amp; whose report is transmitted herewith, there arose on one of them a balance in his favor for part of T C qr/3 10 2 of pigiron delivered. The Commissioners had extended it in money at &#xA3;30. the ton, and transferred the balance of &#xA3;42-5 which that produced to the Credit of his account for the &#xA3;5000. or 666&#x2154; tons of iron. We think they should have credited so much of the T C qr/3 10 2 of iron at &#xA3;30 as would have balanced that account and transferred the residue, in iron, to the credit of his debt due in iron. This error would have been too trivial to have noted to you Sir, but as it tended to induce a false principle into the account, &amp; to prevent us from informing you precisely that of the 666&#x2154; tons due to the public for the &#xA3;5000. there has been paid only T C/1 3&#x2032;, and nothing paid towards discharging the additional &#xA3;2500. To secure these balances the lands in which the money was invested were conveyed to the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>477<span class="bracket">]</span></span> trustees themselves, but under an implied trust, that on payment of the debt conveyances should be made to Ballendine and Reveley: so that it is apprehended that they amount in fact to nothing more than mortgages There is little hope that the balance will ever be paid; an opportunity now occurs not only of making the securities produce to the public the real worth of what was advanced on them, but also of producing it in arms &amp; implements of war, the very articles originally proposed to be obtained by it, and which of all others are most immediately essential to the public safety. But a bill for foreclosing the trust to pass through the usual forms of proceedings in a Court of Chancery will hardly bring us relief till I hope we shall not need it.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1003">2. The general assembly in May 1776 having determined to erect a foundry at Westham for casting ordnance appointed Commissioners for that purpose. For the sum of &#xA3;242.10, which they paid Mr. Ballendine they purchased from him for situating the foundry three acres &amp; an half of land adjacent to a Canal he was opening from Westham, and a right to deduce water from the Canal for turning a boring mill &amp; other works necessary for finishing the Cannon&#x2014;They were also to have free navigation down the canal to the foundry on contributing one moeity to the repairs of that part of the Canal, after it should have been once completed, as he bound himself to compleat it. They erected their foundery and found it necessary to make advances of money to Ballendine to enable him to complete his Canal &amp; dam on which alone they depended for water. The balance <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>478<span class="bracket">]</span></span> due the Commonwealth on these advances is &#xA3;2051-2-5&#xBD; as appears by one of the accounts transmitted herewith: for securing which payments a mortgage had been taken on 46&#xBD; acres of land, the whole of the real property of the said Ballendine at that place, so that the public possessions &amp; interests at this place are the 3&#xBD; acres of land with the foundry on it, a right to draw off water for working their machines for completing the Cannon, a common in the navigation, paying one half the expense of keeping that part of the Canal in repair, &amp; a mortgage on 46&#xBD; acres of land for securing the payment of &#xA3;2051-2-5&#xBD;. But for the state of Mr. Ballendines Dam &amp; Canal &amp; the prospect of obtaining water as long as he is to be depended on for it, I beg leave to refer you to the report of the same commissioners.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1004">3. The extending navigation from Westham to Richmond, besides its other very general importance, being extremely requisite to promote the success of the proposed manufactory by reducing the difficulty &amp; expence attending the transportation of the bulky articles of Coal, wood &amp; other things necessary to be expended on it, and its own very weighty produce, we were led to inquire by what means Mr. Ballendine had got foothold there and on what pretensions he founds a right of constructing the navigable canal. In 1764 the assembly passed an act authorising the opening the falls of James river by subscription of money from individuals and appointing Trustees to take such subscriptions. Some persons accordingly subscribed, but no appearance of the arising of the works, being ever compleated in this way, the assembly <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>479<span class="bracket">]</span></span> after waiting 8 years, to wit, in 1772, passed another act for putting the business into a different train. They directed that as soon as the former &amp; subsequent subscribers or a majority of them should think a sufficient sum raised any ten of them, being subscribers of &#xA3;100 each at last, might appoint a general meeting at which a president &amp; 11 directors should be elected, who should have power to agree with an undertaker to cut the canal proposed, provided such undertaker should first give sufficient security to perform his agreement: they gave to the adventurers authority to carry the canal through any persons lands, paying the worth of them, allowed them certain tolls, and pointed out the precise mode in which they might transfer their shares in the undertaking, to wit, by deed executed by the president, the subscriber having first tendered his share to the directors who were to have the refusal at the same price: very considerable sums were engaged under this act: but there never was a meeting of the subscribers to elect a president &amp; Directors, nor an undertaker employed. While this was in agitation Mr. Ballendine proposing to clear the falls of James river &amp; the falls of Potowmack, set on foot subscriptions for enabling him to go to England to learn how to do it. Great sums were subscribed, he went, returned &amp; brought some workmen. He purchased at the head of the falls of James river the 50 acres of land, three &amp; a half of which were conveyed as before mentioned to the public for the foundery, and the other 46&#xBD; mortgaged to them. He opened a Canal through this land and then of his own <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>480<span class="bracket">]</span></span> authority, without any act of assembly or even an order of Court, as we are told, he made a dam across an arm of James river &amp; drew off 50 feet width of water along his canal. In November 1777 by Petition to the assembly he informs them that the subscribers under the last act of assembly had transferred their interests to him, that he had made considerable progress in the Canal &amp; should finish it if he met with no interruption from those through whose lands it must pass &amp; prays an act might pass vesting him with the former subscribers. Had the allegation in his petition been true, that the former subscribers had transferred their interests to him, such an act would have been unnecessary, because he would have stood on their footing; but it could not be true, because the transfer being to be executed by the president after a tender &amp; refusal of the share to the Company, &amp; no president having ever been elected, there could have been no such transfer to him as he alleged. I have been thus particular, Sir, in order to show you that Mr. Ballendine has no legal right to the conducting the Canal which can stand in the way of the present Contract. He has an equity of redemption in the 46&#xBD; acres of land before mentioned, and so far stands on the footing of every other landholder through whose lands the Canall must pass. He prayed earnestly that their rights might be sacrificed to him, on his paying them the value: can he then with modesty now say that his rights shall not be sacrificed to others, paying him the value of the injury done him? It is now four years since he begun his Canal; he has conducted it about <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>481<span class="bracket">]</span></span> one twentieth part of the whole distance: and this too while his workmen were with him, &amp; his means, if he had any, were fresh.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1005">A very simple calculation then will inform us, that, in his hands the completion of this Work will require near a century, and then a question arises whether Mr. Ballendine will live so long. I think we may fairly conclude that he will never complete it. It is right that in cases of such general importance, the interests of a few individuals should give way to the general good, full compensation being made them; and as right that Mr. Ballendine&#x2019;s should, as those of the others whose Lands were to have been laid open to him. He has had a long enough trial to convince the whole world he never will complete it. Other Gentlemen now offer to do it within a reasonable term. As the assembly then after an eight years trial &amp; failure of the act of 1764 made another experiment in 1772 it seems reasonable, after other seven years patience, to try yet other means. It is possible the present undertakers may not find it necessary to make use of Mr. Ballendine&#x2019;s Canal at all, but may take out the water elsewhere. But should they find that it can be taken off no where else, it is submitted to the assembly, whether his having dug a Canal along grounds thro&#x2019; which the navigable canal must necessarily pass, shall privilege those grounds, more than the meadows &amp; grounds of others are privileged, and for ever obstruct the opening that river, and whether there can be any sound objection to the having in his case, as well as in those of others, a just valuation made of y<span class="sup">e</span> injury <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>482<span class="bracket">]</span></span> he will sustain by the use which shall be made of his Canal, and after withholding the &#xA3;2501.2.5&#xBD; due from him to the public, on that particular account, to pay him the balance if the injury shall be found to exceed that sum.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1006">In stating to you the several obstacles which oppose themselves to the execution of the resolution of assembly, I have been necessarily led to mention circumstances which are to be found among your own journals &amp; acts, &amp; of which therefore you had knowledge before. They were necessary to continue the thread of the relation so as to render it intelligible, and are desired to be considered only as references to your own Records for more authentic and precise information.</p>

<div class="salute csc">Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1013">&#x2014;I have lately received Messages and information from the Cherokee nation of Indians, painting their nakedness and general distress for want of European Goods, so strongly as to call for pity and all possible relief. Their several Settlements being contiguous to the two Carolinas &amp; to Virginia they have at times received Supplies I believe from each of these States. Their great numbers however &amp; the extent of their Settlements, when taken into view by any one of our States, bear a discourageing proportion to the moderate aids we can singly furnish and render a general distribution of them very troublesome. These considerations have induced me to take the Liberty of submitting to your Excellency a proposition (as I do to Governor Rutledge also by a letter of this day&#x2019;s date) to divide the trouble and task of supplying them among our three States.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1014">The division of those Indians into Southern, Middle &amp; Northern Settlements, renders the apportionment of them obvious. The protecting from intrusion the lands of the Southern Cherokees &amp; furnishing them with Goods seems most convenient to South Carolina, the same friendly offices to the Middle settlements seem most within your power &amp; the Northern Settlements are most convenient to us. The attachment which each settlement will by these means acquire to the particular State which is it&#x2019;s immediate <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>485<span class="bracket">]</span></span> patron and benefactor, will be a bond of peace, and will lead to a separation of that powerfull people. If this distribution should happily meet the approbation of your Excellency &amp; of Governor Rutledge, we shall do every thing in our power for discharging our Duties to the Northern settlement. Knowing your disposition to have these people protected in the possession of their unpurchased lands, I also take the liberty of mentioning to you that the old Tassel in a late Message to me complains of intrusions on their lands, and particularly of some attempts to take from them the great island. This, by the late extension of our boundary, falling, as I understand, within your State, removes the application for protection to your Excellency, whose power alone can extend to the removal of intrusions from thence. As to so much of their lands as lie within our latitudes, as well as the lands of other Indians generally, our assembly now sitting has in contemplation to authorise the Executive to send patrols of the military through them from time to time to destroy the habitations which shall be erected in them by intruders. The bearer of this Letter is a Major Martin, our agent residing with the Cherokees who will be able to inform your Excellency of any particulars you may wish to learn. We have reason to believe him a good kind of man &amp; worthy of credit. In tending to fix a post and small Garrison in Powell&#x2019;s valley, we have ordered part of a battalion thither to erect a stockade. But as it would be proper for them first to assemble together (being not yet embodied) at a nearer Station, and there being a fort and houses at the great island, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>486<span class="bracket">]</span></span> we have taken the liberty of appointing their rendezvous at that fort, till there shall be so many embodied as may proceed with safety to Powell&#x2019;s valley. We have reason to expect that their stay at that place will be very short and hope it will not be disagreeable to your Excellency. The necessity of immediate orders, put it out of our power to apply for your previous approbation: We consider the measure still however subject to your pleasure and therefore take this early opportunity of acquainting you with it.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1016">&#x2014;Colo. Bland being about to retire from his Command at the Barracks in Albemarle, and desirous to withdraw at the same time the party of his horse which has hitherto been stationed there, wished that we should supply their place by sending thither about twenty or five and twenty of the horse of this State. Our horse being as yet not very well trained, the officers represented that it would much impede that work, and leave the remaining fragment in a very awkward situation should we divide a troop. We have therefore ordered a complete troop to that station; but wish Congress would be pleased to notify as soon as convenient whether they approve of this or not.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1017">We have hitherto been unable to raise more than about the half of a Battalion of infantry for guarding <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>487<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the Convention Troops at the same Post. The deficiencies have been endeavoured to be supplied with Militia. Congress have had too much experience of the radical defects and inconveniences of militia service to need my enumerating them. Our assembly now sitting, have in contemplation to put the garrison regiment on such a footing as gives us hopes of filling it by the next summer. In the meantime a Battalion which we are raising for our immediate defence may be spared to do garrison duty this winter, and as but a small part of it is raised, as yet, and not probable that it will be completed within any short time, we suppose that with Colo. Taylor&#x2019;s regiment it will not exceed the number required to guard the Troops.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1018">I would observe to you that the Captains and Subalterns of this new Battalion are not to be called into service but as their men are raised; so that the burthen which has sometimes been incurred of paying officers without men need not be apprehended in this instance. We have therefore Ordered this Battalion to rendezvous at the Barracks and do duty there this winter; and that the Battalion should be discharged in proportion as these come in, on this measure also we ask the pleasure of Congress.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1019">The appointment of a successor to Colo. Bland will give us great satisfaction and we hope Congress will take it into early consideration. The duties of that post call for respectable Abilities and an uncommon vigilance and firmness of character.</p>

<div class="salute csc">Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1021">&#x2014;Your Excellency&#x2019;s letter on the discriminations which have been heretofore made between the troops raised within this state and considered as part of our quota, &amp; those not so considered, was delivered me four days ago. I immediately laid it before the Assembly, who thereupon came to the resolution I now do myself the honor of enclosing you. The resolution of Congress of Mar. 15. 1779 which you were so kind as to inclose was never known in this state till a few weeks ago when we received printed copies of the journals of Congress. It would be a great satisfaction to us to receive an exact return of all the men we have in Continental service who come within the descriptions of the resolution, together with our state troops in Continental service. Colo. Cabell was so kind as to send me a return of Octob. 1779. of the Continental regiments commanded by Lord Sterling, of the 1st &amp; 2d Virginia state regiments, and of Colo. Gist&#x2019;s regiment. Besides these are the following viz., Colonel Harrison&#x2019;s regiment of artillery, Colonel&#x2019;s Baylor&#x2019;s horse, Colonel Bland&#x2019;s horse, General Scott&#x2019;s new levies, part of which are gone to Carolina, and part are here, Colonel Gibson&#x2019;s regiment stationed on the Ohio, Heath and O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s independent companies at the same stations, Colonel Taylor&#x2019;s regiment of guards to the Convention troops: of these, we have a return.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1022">There may possibly be others not occurring to me. A return of all these would enable us to see what proportion of the Continental army is contributed by <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>489<span class="bracket">]</span></span> us. We have at present very pressing calls to send additional numbers of men to the Southward. No inclination is wanting in either the legislature or Executive powers to aid them or to strengthen you: but we find it difficult to procure men. I herewith transmit to your Excellency some recruiting commissions to be put into such hands as you may think proper for re-enlisting such of our soaldiery as are not engaged already for the war. The act of assembly authorizing these instructions requires that the men enlisting should be reviewed &amp; received by an officer to be appointed for that purpose; a caution less necessary in the case of men now actually in service, &amp; therefore doubtless able bodied, than in the raising new recruits. The direction however goes to all cases, and therefore we must trouble your Excellency with the appointment of one or more officers of review. Mr. Moss our agent receives orders, which accompany this, to pay the bounty money &amp; recruiting money, &amp; to deliver the clothing. We have however certain reason to fear he has not any great sum of money on hand: and it is absolutely out of our power at this time to supply him, or to say with certainty when we shall be able to do it. He is instructed to note his acceptances under the draughts and to assure payment as soon as we shall have it in our power to furnish him, as the only substitute for money. Your Excellency&#x2019;s directions to the officer of review will probably procure us the satisfaction of being informed from time to time, how many men shall be re-enlisted.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1023">By Colo. Mathews I informed your Excellency <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>490<span class="bracket">]</span></span> fully of the situation of Governor Hamilton &amp; his companions. Lamothe, &amp; Dejean have given their paroles, and are at Hanover court-house: Hamilton, Hay, and four others are still obstinate; they therefore are still in close confinement; tho their irons have never been on, since your second letter on the subject. I wrote full information of this matter to General Phillips also, from whom I had received letters on the subject. I cannot in reason believe that the enemy, on receiving this information either from yourself or General Phillips, will venture to impose any new distresses on our officers in captivity with them. Yet their conduct hitherto has been most successfully prognosticated by reversing the conclusions of right reason. It is therefore my duty, as well as it was my promise, to the Virginia captives to take measures for discovering any change which may be made in their situation. For this purpose I must apply for your Excellency&#x2019;s interposition. I doubt not but you have an established mode of knowing at all times through your commissary of prisoners, the precise state of those in the power of the enemy. I must therefore pray you to put into motion any such means you have of obtaining knowledge of the situation of the Virginia officers in captivity. If you should think proper, as I could wish, to take upon yourself to retaliate, any new sufferings which may be imposed on them, it will be more likely to have due weight, and to restore the unhappy on both sides to that benevolent treatment for which all should wish.</p>

<div class="salute csc">Sir,</div>
</div>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1030">&#x2014;We have information from our Delegates in Congress that the detention of some continental arms by the executive of this State during the course of the last summer has given considerable umbrage to Congress. I beg leave therefore, thro&#x2019; you Sir, to lay before that honorable body facts, simply as they occurred, hoping that these will satisfy them that, the arms being justly due to this State, necessity alone dictated the measure, and that no sentiment of disrespect to Congress entered into the transaction. This State in an early part of the present contest raised at first two, and soon afterwards seven Battalions for its particular defence. Finding however that the dangers of our being invaded became less, our legislature made a tender of these Battalions for the Continental service. The tender was accepted of by Congress only on condition that we would permit them to carry their arms with them. They were accordingly marched to the grand army, time after time, as we could get them armed. I think this condition was dispensed with as to two Battalions only which Congress, induced by their increasing wants of men, permitted <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>493<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to march on without their arms. This is one of the articles of Debit in our account of arms against the Continent, which I state particularly, in order to bring it into recollection with some of your honorable members, and because, being recollected, it will go far in our justification as to the number of arms retained with us. Since this however, at different times, and for different corps, many smaller parcels of arms have been sent to Congress by us. It is a fact, which we are to lament, that, in the earlier part of our struggles, we were so wholly occupied by the great object of establishing our rights, that we attended not at all to those little circumstances of taking receipts, and vouchers, keeping regular accounts, and preparing subjects for future disputes with our friends. If we could have supported the whole Continent, I believe we should have done it, and never dishonored our exertions by producing accounts; sincerely assured that, in no circumstances of future necessity or distress, a like free application of any-thing theirs would have been thought hardly of, or would have rendered necessary an appeal to accounts. Hence it has happened that, in the present case, the collection of vouchers for the arms furnished by this State has become tedious and difficult.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1031">Our board of war has been attending to this business a considerable time, but have as yet authenticated the loan of only 5664 stand of arms and 580 rifles. They seem however to believe that (exclusive of considerable numbers delivered where no receipts were taken and the officers to whom delivered are <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>494<span class="bracket">]</span></span> dead or not to be found, which of course we shall lose) they will be able to establish a right to 10,000 stand. These arms were most of them of the very best quality, imported from Great Britain, by the State, for its own use. After the loan of so many to the continent, the loss of a considerable number put into the hands of the militia during the short invasion of the last spring, many of which we were never able to recover, and a very recent loan of 1000 stand, to be sent on, at the request of Congress, to South Carolina, we were reduced to not more than 3,000 stand in all our magazines. Rumors were spread of an intended invasion by the enemy for the purpose of rescuing the convention Troops: that body of men were in the heart of our Country under a guard not able to furnish centinels for ordinary duty; congress had just recommended to us to prepare for the most immediate and most vigorous operations, and to have our militia ready to march at the shortest warning; the knolege of the low state of our magazines had by some means got abroad, and spread a general alarm among our people: in this situation of things a vessel, loaded with arms, seemed to be guided by the hand of providence into one of our harbours. They were it&#x2019;s true the property of our friends, but of friends indebted to us for those very articles. They were for the common defence too, and we were a part of the Body to be defended. An officer came for the purpose of removing them out of the State. Would circumstances have permitted a previous application to congress, tho&#x2019; not present myself, I so thoroughly know the respect which the executive bears for congress, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>495<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that I am safe in affirming that such an application would most certainly have been made. But had they awaited that ceremony, the arms would have been gone: the continent of course would have been at the expence, and the arms exposed to the injury, and risk of, a double transportation: for I cannot but take for granted that congress would on such an application, in the case of a State so reduced in her magazines, and reduced by Loans to them, have ordered the arms to be replaced. Time however did not admit of this ceremony; the executive therefore retained 5000 stand. We shall not draw examples of similar liberties taken by other States, we shall never recapitulate aids granted to, or taken by our brethren, from the common stock, because we wish it to be freely used for their service, and to draw nothing from it for ourselves unless our distresses should at any time be such as to point us out to them as objects needing the common aid. But we will observe in general, that, between congress and this State, similar freedoms in other articles, had been repeatedly and mutually taken, on many former occasions, and never had been the cause of discontent to either party. This precedent then, strengthened by the existence of an actual Debt, seemed to give a Double sanction to the executive for what they did: nor did any instance occur to them of unreadiness at any time to spare freely on continental requisition any articles within possession or power, which might expose them to experience in turn the disregard of congress. I flatter myself therefore that that honorable Body whenever this matter shall be the subject <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>496<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of their deliberations will be of opinion that the proceedings of the Lieutenant Governor and Council were substantially justifiable. They hope that no want of ceremony, or other smaller circumstance may have been matter of Offence to congress. If in this they should be mistaken, feeling the most real respect for that body, impressed with the idea that its authority can never be wounded without injury to the present union, they are to lament the misapprehension &amp; wish to remove it by assuring you, as they may with truth, that no sentiment of theirs, either on this, or any other occasion, has justified it. A motive of duty and respect to the collective council of our union has led me into this detail to remove all grounds of discontent from among us, and to assure you Sir at the same time that I shall consider as occasions of manifesting my zeal for our sacred cause.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1033">&#x2014;I take the liberty of putting under cover to your Excellency some Letters to Generals Phillips and Reidesel, uninformed whether they are gone into New York or not, and knowing that you can best forward them in either case.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1034">I also trouble you with a letter from the Master of the Flag in this State to the British Commissary of Prisoners in New York, trusting it will thus be more certainly conveyed than if sent to Mr. Adam. It is my wish the British Commissary should return <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>497<span class="bracket">]</span></span> his answer through your Excellency or your Commissary of Prisoners, and that they should not propose under this pretext to send another Flag, as the mission of this Flag is not unattended by circumstances of suspicion, and a certain information of the Situation of ourselves and our allies here might influence the measures of the enemy. Perhaps your Commissary of Prisoners can effect the former method of answer.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1035">I inclose to you part of an act of Assembly ascertaining the quantities of Land which shall be allowed to the officers and soldiers at the close of the war, and providing means of keeping that country vacant which has been allotted to them.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1036">I am advised to ask the attention of your Excellency to the case of Colo. Bland, late commander at the Barracks in Albemarle. When that Gentleman was applied to, to take that Command, he attended the Executive here, and informed them, that he must either decline it, or be supported in such a way as would keep up that respect which was essential to his command without at the same time ruining his private fortune.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1037">The Executive were sensible that he would be exposed to very great and unavoidable expence, they observed that his Command would be in a department separate from any other, and that he actually relieved a Major General from the same service. They did not think themselves authorized to say what should be done in this case, but undertook to represent the matter to Congress and in the mean time gave it as their opinion that a decent table <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>498<span class="bracket">]</span></span> ought to be found for him. On this he undertook the command, and in the course of it incurred expenses which seem to have been unavoidable unless he would have lived in such a way as is hardly reconcilable to the spirit of an officer, or the reputation of those in whose service he is. Governor Henry wrote on the subject to Congress. Colo. Bland did the same; but we learn that they have concluded the allowance to be unprecedented and inadmissable, in the case of an officer of his rank. The Commissaries on this have called on Colo. Bland for reimbursement. A sale of his Estate was about to take place, when we undertook to recommend to them to suspend their demand till we could ask the favor of you to advocate this matter with Congress so far as you think it right, otherwise the ruin of a very worthy officer must inevitably follow.</p>

The reasons which support this opinion as well as those which oppose it will occur to the General Assembly. It is our duty to provide against every event and the Executive are accordingly engaged in concerting proper measures of defence. Among <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>499<span class="bracket">]</span></span> others we think to call an immediate force from the militia to defend the post at York, and to take a proper post on the South side of James river, but the expence, the difficulties which attend a general call of the militia into the field, the disgust it gives them more especially when they find no enemy in place, and the extreme rigor of the season, induce us to refer to the decision of the general assembly, whether we shall on the intelligence already received &amp; now communicated to them, call a competent force of militia to oppose the numbers of the enemy spoken of; or whether we shall make ready all orders &amp; prepare other circumstances, but omit actually issuing these orders till the enemy appear or we have further proof of their intentions? The assembly will also please to determine whether, in case the enemy should make a lodgement in the country, it would be expedient to avail ourselves of the laudable zeal which may prevail on their first landing and enlist a sufficient number to oppose them &amp; to continue in service during the invasion or for any other term. Perhaps it may not be amiss to suggest to the assembly the tardiness of collecting even small numbers of men by divisions, that if any better method should occur to them they may prescribe it. The present state of the Treasury in more points than one, will no doubt be thought an absolute obstacle to every military endeavor which may be necessary.</p>

<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1041">&#x2014;Your letter inclosing the resolutions of Congress relating to the capture of the Portuguese <span class="ital">Snow</span> by Captain Cunningham has remained hitherto unanswered because I hoped Daily to be enabled to write more fully on that subject. The resolutions and documents accompanying them, as soon as received, were put into the hands of our Attorney General for his opinion, with intention to have such proceedings at Law instituted as he should advise. You will see that, by his opinion, which I do myself the honor of inclosing you, the Offence could not be prosecuted here criminally; our act of Assembly, establishing a Court of Admiralty, having, in conformity with the Articles of Confederation, expressly inhibited it from criminal jurisdiction. The General Assembly being then to meet in the month of October, I reserved the subject to be laid before them, which was accordingly done. A great variety however of other Business, which would not admit of being postponed, occasioned them to pretermit this til their next session. So that if the offenders be within the Cognizance of the criminal Law at all (which the attorney seems to doubt) we have as yet no court wherein they may be prosecuted. A Civil action for Damages may be instituted; and if the sufferers shall think proper to direct it, the countenance and protection of Government here shall not be wanting so far as propriety will admit or justice require.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1042">I am to acknowledge the receipt of your Letter of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>501<span class="bracket">]</span></span> December 10th, inclosing resolutions of Congress of the same Date, approving our measures for guarding the Convention Troops, and accepting the resignation of Colo. Bland. I hope that, ere this, his place has been supplied, as the constant attention of an officer of knowledge and understanding is requisite there. Perhaps his troubles might be lessened and his office more fully discharged, by residing at the Barracks, rather than at Charlottesvile; these posts being five or six miles apart.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1043">The resolutions of the 11th &amp; 14th inst, inclosed in your letter of the 14th unfortunately came not to hand till two Days after the rising of the General Assembly, which was on the 24th, and they will not meet again before the period for the delivery of the Indian Corn will be passed. They had however, early in the present year, laid a Tax payable in specific commodities; and, in their late session, directed the Executive to raise from the proceeds of that Tax, six hundred thousand pounds, towards making up the quota&#x2019;s of money for which they were called on by Congress. The articles specified were Wheat, Indian Corn, rye, Barley, Oats, hemp and Tobacco at the option of the payer, but it is conjectured that paiment will be made almost wholly in Indian Corn &amp; Tobacco. I am in hopes that, on those acts of the legislature, we shall be enabled to comply with your requisition as to the specific article and quantity required, as we may retain the Tax in its specific form instead of converting it into money: but we shall fail in point of time; because it happens, that the ultimate term <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>502<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of paiment allowed for this Tax is the Day on which your resolutions require delivery of it to your Commissary at such places as he shall appoint. In this point then will be felt the misfortune of the legislature&#x2019;s separation before receipt of the resolutions; the Executive having no powers to shorten the Day of paiment. I thought it my duty to give you this early notice of the particular part of that requisition, with which, from these circumstances we shall be unable to comply, that the ill effects of disappointment may be lessened by other timely measures.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1044">The resolution of the 15th Instant recommending the continuance of embargoes is also received, that measure had been adopted some time ago as you will see by the proclamation inclosed.</p>
<p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1045">I shall hereafter according to the desire of your Secretary transmit you copies of our acts of Assembly by which you will receive more minute information of the measures taken in consequence of your recommendations from time to time than the compass of a letter would admit.</p>

Wherefore the libellants prayed that the said Patrick Lunan might be corrected, punished and deprived, or otherwise, that right and justice might be administered. The defendant pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court, and on that plea it came to be argued in October 1771. . . . The Court adjudged that they possessed ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and that as an ecclesiastical court they might proceed to censure or deprive the defendant, if there should be just cause.&#x201D;</p></div>

It was offered in the Convention, Mar. 27, 1775, and in pursuance of it, Henry, Bland, Jefferson, Nicholas, and Pendleton were appointed a committee, but seem to have done nothing concerning it. At the next session, on July 18th, a new committee was named, and on the arrival of Harrison, Henry, and Jefferson, on Aug. 9, they were added to this second committee, but it was equally fruitless of results. &#x201C;One of the last acts of the Convention was dictated by a proclamation of the governor . . . declaring that the king had given orders that all vacant lands should be put up in lots at public sale. . . . It was an innovation on the established usage of granting lands within the Colony. Announced that revenue was to be hunted for in disregard of charters and ancient habits, and to be embraced in it minutest shapes. To attack this new head of the hydra of precedent, a committee was appointed of Patrick Henry, Richard Bland, Thomas Jefferson, Robert Carter Nicholas, and Edmund Randolph, to inquire whether his majesty may of right advance the terms of granting lands in this colony, and to make report to the next General assembly or Convention. But this affair was lost in the subsequent events, and at any other time would probably have died away with those numerous thoughtless acquiences with which our history is strewed, in exercises of doubtful prerogative.&#x201D;&#x2014;Edmund Randolph&#x2019;s (MS.) <span class="ital">History of Virginia,</span> ii., 35.</p>

On June 23d accordingly, &#x201C;on a motion&#x201D; the Congress &#x201C;<span class="ital">Resolved,</span> That a Committee of five be chosen to draw up a Declaration to be published by General <span class="ital">Washington,</span> upon his Arrival at the Camp before <span class="ital">Boston.</span> The Committee chosen are Mr. J.

Jefferson added to the committee. The latter being desired by the commee to draw up a new one, he prepared this paper. On a meeting of the commee J. Dickinson objected that it was too harsh, wanted softening &amp;c. Whereupon the commee desired him to retouch it, which he did in the form which they reported July 6, which was adopted by Congress.&#x201D;</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1112">And in his Autobiography Jefferson further stated:</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1113">&#x201C;On the 24th a committee which had been appointed to prepare a declaration of the causes of the taking up arms brought in their report (drawn I believe by J. Rutledge) which, not being liked, the House recommitted it, on the 26th and added Mr. Dickinson and myself to the committee. On the rising of the House, the committee not having yet met I happen to find myself near Governor W. Livingston, and proposed to him to draw the paper. He excused himself, and proposed that I should draw it. . . . I prepared a draught of the declaration committed to us. It was too strong for Mr. Dickinson. He still retained the hope of reconciliation with the mother country, and was unwilling it should be lessened by offensive statements. He was so honest a man, and so able a one, that he was greatly indulged even by those who could not feel his scruples. We therefore requested him to take the paper, and put it into a form he could approve. He did so, preparing an entire new statement, and preserving of the former only the last four paragraphs and the half of the preceding one. We approved and reported it to Congress.&#x201D;</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1114">William Livingston also wrote (<span class="ital">to Stirling,</span> July 4th):</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1115">&#x201C;We are now working upon a Manifesto on arming. The first was not liked by the Congress and was recomitted. The second was not liked by the committee. Both had the faults common to our Southern gentlemen. Much fault-finding and declamation, with little sense or dignity. They seem to think a reiteration of tyranny, despotism, bloody, &amp;c. all that is needed to unite us at home and convince the bribed voters of North of the justice of our cause.&#x201D;</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1116">It is evident from a comparison of these two drafts, with Dickinson&#x2019;s draft (reproduced in Dr. George H. Moore&#x2019;s <span class="ital">John Dickinson</span>) as well as with that ultimately adopted by the Congress (<span class="ital">Journal,</span> July 6th), that Jefferson is mistaken in claiming the final paragraphs of that accepted as his. Dickinson has certainly embodied a few of Jefferson&#x2019;s phrases and ideas, but not more so in those than in the other parts of the Declaration.</p></div>

Y., not merely for photographic reproductions, but also for the facts concerning them given at large in the latter&#x2019;s <span class="ital">Jefferson&#x2019;s Constitution for Virginia</span> (<span class="ital">The Nation,</span> li., 107). This constitution, though mentioned in several of the histories and other works concerning Virginia, and though seen by Wirt (<span class="ital">Life of Patrick Henry,</span> p. 196), and by Leigh (<span class="ital">Debates of Virginia Convention, 1830,</span> p. 160), has never yet been printed or even quoted. The history of its production is as follows:</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1150">On December 4, 1775, the Continental Congress resolved that if the &#x201C;Convention of Virginia shall find it necessary to establish a form of government in that Colony, it be recommended to that Convention to call a full and free representation of the people, and that the said representatives, if they think it necessary, establish such forms of government as in their judgment will best produce the happiness of the people.&#x201D; The Convention received this resolution on Dec. 13th, but took no action upon it. In April a new Convention was elected, which met on May 6th, and on May 15th appointed a Committee to prepare a &#x201C;Declaration of Rights&#x201D; and a &#x201C;Form of Government.&#x201D; In the meantime the Continental Congress, on motion of John Adams, May 10, 1776, &#x201C;recommended to the respective assemblies and conventions of these United Colonies where no government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs hath been hitherto established, to adopt such government as shall in the opinion of the representatives of the people best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular, and America in general.&#x201D; On May 27th the resolutions of the Virginia Convention were laid before the Continental Congress, and between that date and the middle part of June, Jefferson, while attending Congress, drew up this constitution. This he forwarded to Pendleton in the Convention, by George Wythe, who was returning from Congress to Virginia, and the latter wrote him, July 27, 1776:</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1151">&#x201C;When I came here the plan of government had been committed to the whole house. To those who had the chief hand in forming it the one you put into my hands was shewn. Two or three parts of this were, with little alteration, inserted in that: but such was the impatience of sitting long enough to discuss several important points in which they differ, and so many other matters were necessary to be dispatched before the adjournment that I was persuaded the revision of a subject the members seemed tired of would at that time have been unsuccessfully proposed.&#x201D; Of it, Jefferson, in 1825, wrote:</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1152">&#x201C;I was then at Philadelphia with Congress; and knowing that the Convention of Virginia was engaged in forming a plan of government, I turned my mind to the same subject, and drew a sketch or outline of a Constitution, with a preamble, which I sent to Mr. Pendleton, president of the convention, on the mere possibility that it might suggest something worth incorporation into that before the Convention. He informed me afterwards by letter, that he received it on the day on which the Committee of the Whole had reported to the House the plan they had agreed to; that that had been so long in hand, so disputed inch by inch, and the subject of so much altercation and debate; that they were worried with the contentions it had produced, and could not, from mere lassitude, have been induced to open the instrument again; but that, being pleased with the Preamble to mine, they adopted it in the House, by way of amendment to the Report of the Committee; and thus my Preamble became tacked to the work of George Mason. The Constitution, with the Preamble, was passed on the 29th of June, and the Committee of Congress had only the day before that reported to that body the draught of the Declaration of Independence. The fact is, that that Preamble was prior in composition to the Declaration; and both having the same object, of justifying our separation from Great Britain, they used necessarily the same materials of justification, and hence their similitude.&#x201D;</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1153">Jefferson, both at the time, and afterwards, denied the power of the Virginia Convention to adopt a permanent constitution, on the grounds that it was chosen an executive body to carry on the war, and that independence and the establishment of a state government were not before the people when they chose the delegates to it. Edmund Randolph (MS. <span class="ital">History of Virginia,</span> p. 63) states that:</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1154">&#x201C;Mr. Jefferson, who was in Congress, urged a youthful friend in the convention to oppose a permanent constitution until the people should elect deputies for the special purpose. He denied the power of the body elected (as he conceived them to be agents for the management of the war) to exceed some temporary regimen.&#x201D; The leading members of the Convention, however, according to Randolph, &#x201C;saw no distinction between the conceded powers to declare independence, and its necessary consequence, the fencing of society by the institution of government.&#x201D;</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1155">In pursuance of his opinion, Jefferson&#x2019;s proposed constitution was given the form of a mere act, and much is included which has no place in a constitution. The non-concurrence of the Convention in his view, and even more, the aristocratic limits on the franchise and the unfavorable discrimination against the western counties, that the planter and tide-water representatives secured, which made &#x201C;no grosser error than to suppose that the Constitution of Virginia was formed in 1776, [for] its two great distinctive features, the <span class="ital">sectional,</span> and the <span class="ital">aristocratic,</span> had been given to it a century before&#x201D; (<span class="ital">Debates of Virginia Convention, 1830</span>), were the causes for his dislike of the Constitution adopted in 1776, and of his constant attempts to obtain its alteration. His objections are indicated in his <span class="ital">Notes on Virginia</span> (Query XIII, &#xB6; 5) as well as in his correspondence, and his preparation of his &#x201C;Fundamental Constitution&#x201D; in 1783 and his &#x201C;Notes for a Constitution&#x201D; in 1794; both of which form striking examples, in contrast to this, of the democratic development of his mind.</p></div>

John Adams states (<span class="ital">Works,</span> iii., 31): &#x201C;Jealousies and divisions appeared among the delegates of no State, more remarkably than among those of Virginia.&#x201D; In the Virginia Assembly, R. H. Lee had antagonized the planter interest, by his course on the accounts of Treasurer Robinson, and that class had set up Benjamin Harrison as their representative. In 1776, by the influence and votes of the Lee party, Harrison and Braxton were left out of the delegation, by means which a member of the neutral party (Pendleton) claimed to be &#x201C;disgraceful.&#x201D; The former on his return to Virginia secured an election to the vacancy caused by the resignation of Jefferson; but on Wythe&#x2019;s retirement, the Lees succeeded in filling his seat with one of their own interest, Mann Page. In turn, the Harrison faction began a counter attack on R. H. Lee, but apparently first attempted to veil it under a general act of the assembly. For this purpose, May 12, 1777, they ordered the preparation of a bill regulating the appointment of delegates, and named Jefferson alone to draft it&#x2014;the only case I have discovered of a single individual being so selected. He was already pledged, by his resolution offered in the Continental Congress (<span class="ital">ante,</span> p. 220), to a limited term of two years for this office; and a bill prepared on these lines would legislate Lee out of office. On May 12th, he reported this draft of a bill, and after a severe struggle, it was committed to the Committee of the Whole by a vote of only 42 to 40. It was here discussed and amended on the 14th and 15th, and on the 16th, was passed by the Delegates. In the Senate, it was amended and returned; on May 21st, the Delegates amended the Senate amendments, which were concurred in by the Senate, and it became a law. Lee, though &#x201C;it was impossible . . . to avoid feeling the immediate ill treatment that I had received&#x201D; &#x201C;from a wicked industry, the most false and most malicious that the deceitful heart of man ever produced,&#x201D; seemed to have felt no ill-will toward Jefferson for his part in the affair. He returned to Virginia to secure an election to the House of Delegates, &#x201C;was left out of the last chosen convention, but . . . harangued the people of the back Country, in the field &amp; bought off one of their representatives to decline, payed his fine, to procure His return in his stead. Returned to the convention, His Brothers, by threats &amp; Cabals, procured his appointment to General Congress.&#x201D;&#x2014;(<span class="ital">Stevens MSS.</span> No. 277.) At the same session of the legislature, he secured the introduction of a new bill dealing with this question, of which apparently Jefferson was likewise the drafter, and which is printed in the <span class="ital">Session Acts</span> for 1778, p. 20, and in the <span class="ital">Report of the Revisers,</span> p. 9 <span class="ital">Cf.

It was a violation of article 8 of the Virginia Declaration of Rights and was afterwards cited by Edmund Randolph (Debates, Virginia Convention of 1788, <span class="ital">Elliot,</span> iii., 66) as such, in the following words: &#x201C;There is one example of this violation in Virginia, of a most striking and shocking nature,&#x2014;an example so horrid, that, if I conceived my country would passively permit a repetition of it, dear as it is to me, I would seek means of expatriating myself from it. A man who was then a citizen, was deprived of his life thus: from a mere reliance on general reports, a gentleman in the House of Delegates informed the house that a certain man (Josiah Philips) had committed several crimes, and was running at large perpetrating other crimes. He therefore moved leave to attaint him; he obtained that leave instantly; no sooner did he obtain it, than he drew from his pocket a bill ready written for that effect; it was read three times in one day and carried to the Senate. I will not say that it passed the same day through the Senate; but he was attainted very speedily and precipitately, without any proof better than these vague reports. Without being confronted with his accusers and witnesses, without the privilege of calling evidence on his behalf, he was sentenced to death, and was afterwards actually executed.&#x201D; To this Henry replied (<span class="ital">Elliot,</span> iii., 140): &#x201C;The honorable member has given you an elaborate account of what he judges tyrannical legislation, and an <span class="ital">ex post facto law,</span> (in the case of Josiah Philips). He has misrepresented the facts. That man was not executed by a tyrannical stroke of power. Nor was he a Socrates. He was a fugitive murderer and an outlaw&#x2014;a man who commanded an infamous banditti, and at a time when the war was at the most perilous stage. He committed the most cruel and shocking barbarities. He was an enemy to the human name. Those who declare war against the human race may be struck out of existence as soon as they are apprehended. He was not executed according to those beautiful legal ceremonies which are pointed out by the laws in criminal cases. The enormity of his crimes did not entitle him to it. I am truly a friend to legal forms and methods; but, sir, the occasion warranted the measure. A pirate, an outlaw, or a common enemy to all mankind, may be put to death at any time. It is justified by the laws of nature and nations.&#x201D;</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1221">Jefferson&#x2019;s attention was first called to these statements in reading the proof sheets of Girardin&#x2019;s <span class="ital">History of Virginia.</span> He at once wrote to Girardin (March 12, 1815):</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1222">&#x201C;I return the three Cativers, which I have perused with the usual satisfaction. You will find a few pencilled notes merely verbal.</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1223">&#x201C;But in one place I have taken a greater liberty than I ever took before, or ever indeed had occasion to take. It is in the case of Josiah Philips, which I find strangely represented by Judge Tucker and Mr. Edmund Randolph, and very negligently vindicated by Mr. Henry. That case is personally known to me, because I was of the legislature at the time, was one of those consulted by Mr. Henry, and had my share in the passage of the bill. I never before saw the observations of those gentlemen, which you quote on this case, and will now therefore briefly make some strictures on them.</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1224">&#x201C;Judge Tucker, instead of a definition of the functions of bills of attainder, has given a diatribe against their abuse. The occasion and proper office of a bill of attainder is thus: When a person charged with a crime withdraws from justice, or resists it by force, either in his own or a foreign country, no other means of bringing him to trial or punishment being practicable, a special act is passed by the legislature adapted to the particular case. This prescribes to him a sufficient time to appear and submit to a trial by his peers; declares that his refusal to appear shall be taken as a confession of guilt, as in the ordinary case of an offender at the bar refusing to plead, and pronounces the sentence which would have been rendered on his confession or conviction in a court of law. No doubt that these acts of attainder have been abused in England as instruments of vengence by a successful over a defeated party. But what institution is insusceptible of abuse in wicked hands?</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1225">&#x201C;Again, the judge says &#x2018;the court refused to pass sentence of execution pursuant to the direction of the act.&#x2019; The court could not refuse this, because it was never proposed to them; and my authority for this assertion shall be presently given.</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1226">&#x201C;For the perversion of a fact so intimately known to himself, Mr. Randolph can be excused only by our indulgence for orators who, pressed by a powerful adversary, lose sight, in the ardor of conflict of the rigorous accuracies of fact, and permit their imagination to distort and color them to the views of the moment. He was Attorney-General at the time, and told me himself, the first time I saw him after the trial of Philips, that when taken and delivered up to justice, he had thought it best to make no use of the act of attainder, and to take no measure under it; that he had indicted him at the common law either for murder or robbery (I forgot which and whether for both); that he was tried on this indictment in the ordinary way, found guilty by the jury, sentenced and executed under the common law; a course which every one approves, because the first object of the act of attainder was to bring him to fair trial. Whether Mr. Randolph was right in this information to me, or when in the debate with Mr. Henry, he represents this atrocious offender as sentenced and executed under the act of attainder, let the record of the case decide.</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1227">&#x201C;&#x2018;Without being confronted with his accusers and witnesses, without the privilege of calling for evidence in his behalf, he was sentenced to death, and afterwards actually executed.&#x2019; I appeal to the universe to produce one single instance from the first establishment of government in this State to the present day, where, in a trial at bar, a criminal has been refused confrontation with his accusers and witnesses, or denied the privilege of calling for evidence in his behalf; had it been done in this case, I would have asked of the Attorney-General why he proposed or permitted it. But without having seen the record, I will venture on the character of our courts, to deny that it was done. But if Mr. Randolph meant only that Philips had not these advantages on the passage of the bill of attainder, how idle to charge the legislature with omitting to confront the culprit with his witnesses, when he was standing out in arms and in defiance of their authority, and their sentence was to take effect only on his own refusal to come in and be confronted. We must either therefore consider this as a mere hyperbolism of imagination in the heat of debate, or what I should rather believe, a defective statement by the reporter of Mr. Randolph&#x2019;s argument. I suspect this last the rather because this point in the charge of Mr. Randolph is equally omitted in the defence of Mr. Henry. This gentleman must have known that Philips was tried and executed under the common law, and yet, according to his report, he rests his defence on a justification of the attainder only. But all who knew Mr. Henry, know that when at ease in argument, he was sometimes careless, not giving himself the trouble of ransacking either his memory or imagination for all the topics of his subject or his audience that of hearing them. No man on earth knew better when he had said enough for his hearers.</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1228">&#x201C;Mr. Randolph charges us with having read the bill three times in the same day. I do not remember the fact, nor whether this was enforced on us by the urgency of the ravages of Philips, or of the time at which the bill was introduced. I have some idea it was at or near the close of the session; the journals, which I have not, will ascertain the fact.</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1229">&#x201C;After the particular strictures I will proceed to propose, 1st, that the word &#x2018;substantially,&#x2019; page 92, l. 8., be changed for &#x2018;which has been charged with&#x2019; (subjoining a note of reference. 1. Tucker&#x2019;s Blackst. Append., 292. Debates of Virginia Convention).</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1230">&#x201C;2. That the whole of the quotations from Tucker, Randolph and Henry, be struck out, and instead of the text beginning page 92 l. 12, with the words &#x2018;bills of attainder, &amp;c.,&#x2019; to the words &#x2018;so often merited,&#x2019; page 95 l. 4, be inserted the following, to-wit:</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1231">&#x201C;&#x2018;This was passed on the following occasion. A certain Joshua Philips, laborer of the parish of Lynhaven, in the county of Princess Anne, a man of daring and ferocious disposition, associating with other individuals of a similar cast, spread terror and desolation through the lower country, committing murders, burning houses, wasting farms, and perpetrating other enormities, at the bare mention of which humanity shudders. Every effort to apprehend him proved abortive. Strong in the number of his ruffian associates, or where force would have failed resorting to stratagem and ambush, striking the deadly blow or applying the fatal torch at the midnight hour, and in those places which their insulated situation left almost unprotected, he retired with impunity to his secret haunts, reeking with blood and loaded with plunder. [So far the text of Mr. Girardin is preserved.] The inhabitants of the counties which were the theatre of his crimes, never secure a moment by day or by night, in their fields or their beds, sent representations of their distresses to the governor, claiming the public protection. He consulted with some members of the legislature then sitting, on the best method of proceeding against the atrocious offender. Too powerful to be arrested by the sheriff and his <span class="ital">posse comitatus,</span> it was not doubted but an armed force might be sent to hunt and destroy him and his accomplices in their morasses and fastness wherever found. But the proceeding concluded to be most consonant with the forms and principles of our government, was that the legislature should pass an act giving him a reasonable but limited day to surrender himself to justice, and to submit to a trial by his peers. According to the laws of the land, to consider a refusal as a confession of guilt, and divesting him as an outlaw of the character of citizen, to pass on him the sentence prescribed by the law; and the public officer being defied, to make every one his deputy, and especially those whose safety hourly depended on his destruction. The case was laid before the legislature, the proofs were ample, his outrages as notorious as those of the public enemy, and well known to the members of both houses from those counties. No one pretended then that the perpetrator of crimes who could successfully resist the officers of justice, should be protected in the continuance of them, by the privileges of his citizenship, and that baffling ordinary process, nothing extraordinary could be rightfully adopted to protect the citizens against him. No one doubted that society had a right to erase from the role of its members any one who rendered his own existence inconsistent with theirs; to withdraw from him the protection of their laws, and to remove him from among them by exile, or even by death if necessary. An enemy in lawful war, putting to death in cold blood the prisoner he has taken, authorizes retaliation, which would be inflicted with peculiar justice on the individual guilty of the deed, were it to happen that he should be taken. And could the murders and robberies of a pirate or outlaw entitle him to more tenderness? They passed the law, therefore, and without opposition. He did not come in before the day prescribed; continued his lawless outrages; was afterwards taken in arms, but delivered over to the ordinary justice of the county. The Attorney-General for the commonwealth, the immediate agent of the government, waiving all appeal to the act of attainder, indicted him at the common law as a murderer and robber. He was arraigned on that indictment in the usual forms, before a jury of his vicinage, and no use whatever made of the act of attainder in any part of the proceedings. He pleaded that he was a British subject, authorized to bear arms by a commission from Lord Dunmore; that he was therefore a mere prisoner of war, and under the protection of the law of nations. The court being of opinion that a commission from an enemy could not protect a citizen in deeds of murder and robbery, over-ruled his plea; he was found guilty by his jury, sentenced by the court, and executed by the ordinary officer of justice, and all according to the forms and rules of the common law.&#x2019;</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1232">&#x201C;I recommend an examination of the records for ascertaining the facts of this case, for although my memory assures me of the leading ones, I am not so certain in my recollection of the details. I am not sure of the character of the particular crimes committed by Philips, or charged in his indictment, whether his plea of alien enemy was formally put in and over-ruled, what were the specific provisions of the act of attainder, the urgency which caused it to be read three times in one day, if the fact were, &amp;c., &amp;c.&#x201D;</p></div>

On this matter was founded a very bitter attack on Jefferson. This loan was made in 1773. On Jones pressing for payment in 1779, Jefferson tendered him Continental currency, depreciated to an extent which made this tender less than one quarter of the amount originally received. Jones preferred to refuse it entirely (though under the law the tender constituted payment) on the ground that in a personal debt such pretended payment was dishonorable and fictitious. Jefferson never replied to Jones&#x2019;s protest, but when in France, several years later, his agent made payment in full. The affair was first made public by J. T. Callender, in <span class="ital">The Recorder</span> of Dec. 8, 1802. This led to considerable controversy, and finally induced Jones to write a narrative of the transaction, which is in <span class="ital">The Recorder</span> of June 4, 1803. In the <span class="ital">National Intelligencer</span> of July 1, 1803 is a piece signed &#x201C;Timoleon,&#x201D; in defence of Jefferson which was undoubtedly inspired, if not written, by Jefferson.

In its style, I have aimed at accuracy, brevity, and simplicity, preserving, however, the very words of the established law, wherever their meaning had been sanctioned by judicial decisions, or rendered technical by usage. The same matter, if couched in the modern statutory language, with all its tautologies, redundancies, and circumlocutions, would have spread itself over many pages, and been unintelligible to those whom it most concerns. Indeed, I wished to exhibit a sample of reformation in the barbarous style into which modern statutes have degenerated from their ancient simplicity. And I must pray you to be as watchful over what I have not said, as what is said; for the omissions of this bill have all their positive meaning. I have thought it better to drop, in silence, the laws we mean to discontinue, and let them be swept away by the general negative words of this, than to detail them in clauses of express repeal. By the side of the text I have written the notes I made, as I went along, for the benefit of my own memory. They may serve to draw your attention to questions, to which the expressions or the omissions of the text may give rise. The extracts from the Anglo-Saxon laws, the sources of the Common law, I wrote in their original, for my own satisfaction; but I have added Latin, or liberal English translations.

The effect of this law then is, to make what, in its nature, is only presumptive evidence of a murder conclusive of that fact. To this I answer, 1. So many children die before or soon after birth, that to presume all those murdered who are found dead, is a presumption which will lead us oftener wrong than right, and consequently would shed more blood than it would save. 2. If the child were born dead, the mother would naturally choose rather to conceal it, in hopes of still keeping a good character in the neighborhood. So that the act of concealment is far from proving the guilt of murder on the mother. 3. If shame be a powerful affection of the mind, is not parental love also? Is it not the strongest affection known? Is it not greater than even that of self-preservation? While we draw presumptions from shame, one affection of the mind against the life of the prisoner, should we not give some weight to presumptions from parental love, an affection at least as strong, in favor of life? If concealment of the fact is a presumptive evidence of murder, so strong as to overbalance all other evidence that may possibly be produced to take away the presumption, why not trust the force of this incontestable presumption to the jury, who are, in a regular course, to hear presumptive, as well as positive testimony? If the presumption arising from the act of concealment, may be destroyed by proof positive of circumstantial to the contrary, why should the legislature preclude that contrary proof? Objection. The crime is difficult to prove, being usually committed in secret. Answer. But circumstantial proof will do; for example, marks of violence, the behavior, countenance, &amp;c. of the prisoner, &amp;c. And if conclusive proof be difficult to be obtained, shall we therefore fasten irremovably upon equivocal proof? Can we change the nature of what is contestable and make it incontestable? Can we make that conclusive which God and nature have made inconclusive? Solon made no law against parricide, supposing it impossible that any one could be guilty of it; and the Persians, from the same opinion, adjudged all who killed their reputed parents to be bastards; and although parental be yet stronger than filial affection, we admit saticide proved on the most equivocal testimony, whilst they rejected all proof of an act certainly not more repugnant to nature, as of a thing impossible, unprovable.

Homicides are, 1. Justifiable. 2. Excusable. 3. Felonious. For the last, punishments have been already provided. The first are held to be totally without guilt, or rather commendable. The second are in some cases not quite unblamable. These should subject the party to marks of contrition; viz., the killing of a man in defence of property; so also in defence of one&#x2019;s person, which is a species of excusable homicide; because, although cases may happen where these also are commendable, yet most frequently they are done on too slight appearance of danger; as in return for a blow, kick, fillip, &amp;c.; or on a person&#x2019;s getting into a house, not animo furandi, but perhaps veneris causa, &amp;c. Bracton says, &#x201C;si quis furem nocturnum occident, ita demum impune foret, si parcere ei sine periculo suo non potuit, si autem potuit, aliter erit.&#x201D; &#x201C;Item erit si quis hamsokne qu&#xE6; dicitur invasio domus contra pacem domini regis in domo sua se defenderit, et invasor occisus fuerit; impersecutus et insultus remanebit, si ille quem invasit aliter se defendere non potuit; dicitur enim quod non est dignus habere pacem qui non vult observare eam.&#x201D; L. 3. c. 23. &#xA7; 3. &#x201C;Qui latronem occiderit, non tenetur, nocturnum vel diurnum, si aliter periculum evadere non possit; tenetur tamen si possit.

H. 8. c. 5. is therefore merely declaratory of the Common law. See on the general subject Puffend. 2. 5. &#xA7; 10. 11. 12. 16. 17. Excusable homicides are by misadventure, or in self-defence. It is the opinion of some lawyers, that the Common law punished these with death, and that the statute of Marlbridge c. 26. and Gloucester, c. 9. first took away this by giving them title to a pardon, as matter of right, and a writ of restitution of their goods. See 2. Inst. 148. 315. 3. Inst. 55. Bracton L. 3. c. 4. &#xA7; 2. Fleta L. 1. c. 23. &#xA7; 14. 15. 21. E. 3. 23. But it is believed never to have been capital. 1. H. P. C. 425. 1 Hawk. 75. Foster, 282. 4. Bl. 188. It seems doubtful also, whether at Common law, the party forfeited all his chattels in this case, or only paid a weregild. Foster, ubi supra, doubts, and thinks it of no consequence, as the statute of Gloucester entitles the party to Royal grace, which goes as well to forfeiture as life. To me there seems no reason for calling these excusable homicides, and the killing a man in defence of property, a justifiable homicide. The latter is less guiltless than misadventure or self-defence.</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1273">Suicide is by law punishable by forfeiture of chattels. This bill exempts it from forfeiture. The suicide injures the State less than he who leaves it with his effects. If the latter then be not punished, the former should not. As to the example, we need not fear its influence. Men are too much attached to life, to exhibit frequent instances of depriving themselves of it. At any rate, the quasi-punishment of confiscation will not prevent it. For if one be found who can calmly determine to renounce life, who is so weary of his existence here, as rather to make experiment of what is beyond the grave, can we suppose him, in such a state of mind, susceptible of influence from the losses to his family from confiscation? That men in general, too, disapprove of this severity, is apparent from the constant practice of juries finding the suicide in a state of insanity; because they have no other way of saving the forfeiture. Let it then be done away.&#x2014;<span class="ital">T. J.</span></p></div>

It was originally introduced to the Assembly June 13, 1779, and was promptly the subject of memorials, both <span class="ital">pro</span> and <span class="ital">con,</span> to that body. Evidently the majority of the members agreed with one of these memorials, which styled it a &#x201C;diabolical scheme,&#x201D; for it was laid over from session to session till 1786, when, by the foolish attempt of the &#x201C;state-church&#x201D; party to obtain a general assessment, the Assembly re-acted, and passed this bill into law, after first partially substituting a clause of the Virginia Declaration of Rights in place of Jefferson&#x2019;s original wording. Jefferson, then in Paris, promptly had an edition printed with the title:</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1310"><span class="ital">An Act for establishing Religious Freedom, &#xA6; passed by the assembly of Virginia in the beginning &#xA6; of the year 1786.</span> [Paris: 1786.] 8vo, pp. 4.</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1311">In the same year it was again printed in Paris as:</p><p id="Jefferson_0054-02_1312"><span class="ital">Acte de la R&#xE9;publique de Virginie, &#xA6; qui &#xE9;tablit la libert&#xE9; de Religion.</span> [Paris: Ph.
