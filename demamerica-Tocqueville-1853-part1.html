I do not want him to be concerned with me. You will also not find in this book a complete summary of all the institutions of the United States; but I flatter myself that, in it, the public will find some new documentation and, from it, will gain useful knowledge about a subject that is <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>4<span class="bracket">]</span></span> more important for us than the fate of America and no less worthy of holding our attention.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt360" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt360_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a>]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_771">Among the new objects that attracted my attention during my stay in the United States, none struck me more vividly than the equality of conditions.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt361" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt361_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> I discovered without difficulty the prodigious influence that this primary fact exercises on the march of society; it gives a certain direction to the public mind, a certain turn to the laws; to those governing, new maxims, and particular habits to the governed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_772">Soon I recognized that this same fact extends its influence far beyond political mores and laws, and that it has no less dominion over civil society, than over government: it creates opinions, gives birth to sentiments, suggests customs and modifies all that it does not produce.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_773">Therefore, as I studied American society, I saw more and more, in equality of conditions, the generating fact from which each particular fact seemed to derive, and I rediscovered it constantly before me as a central point where all of my observations came together.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_774">Then I turned my thought back toward our hemisphere, and it seemed to me that I perceived something analogous to the spectacle that the New World offered me. I saw equality of conditions that, without having reached its extreme limits as in the United States, approached those limits <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>5<span class="bracket">]</span></span> more each day; and this same democracy that reigned in American societies, appeared to me to advance rapidly toward power in Europe.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt362" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt362_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_775">From that moment, I conceived the idea of the book you are about to read.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt363" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt363_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>6<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_776">A great democratic revolution is taking place<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt364" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt364_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a> among us; everyone sees it, but not everyone judges it in the same way. Some consider it as something new and, taking it for an accident, they hope still to be able to stop it; while others judge it irresistible, because it seems to them the most continuous, oldest and most permanent fact known in history.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_777">I look back for a moment to what France was seven hundred years ago: I find it divided up among a small number of families who own the land and govern the inhabitants; at that time, the right to command is passed down with inheritances from generation to generation; men have only a single way to act on one another, force; you discover only a single source of power, landed property.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_778">But then the political power of the clergy becomes established and is soon expanding.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt365" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt365_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a> The clergy opens its ranks to all, to the poor and to the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>7<span class="bracket">]</span></span> rich, to the commoner and to the lord; equality begins to penetrate through the Church into the government, and someone who would have vegetated as a serf in eternal slavery takes his place as a priest among nobles and often goes to take a seat above kings.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_779">As society becomes more civilized and more stable with time, the different relationships among men become more complicated and more numerous. The need for civil laws is intensely felt. Then jurists arise; they emerge from the dark precinct of the courts and from the dusty recess of the clerks’ offices, and they go to sit in the court of the prince, alongside feudal barons covered with ermine and iron.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_780">Kings ruin themselves in great enterprises; nobles exhaust themselves in private wars; commoners enrich themselves in commerce. The influence of money begins to make itself felt in affairs of State. Trade is a new source of power, and financiers become a political power that is scorned and flattered.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_781">Little by little, enlightenment spreads; the taste for literature and the arts reawakens; then the mind becomes an element of success; knowledge is a means of government; intelligence, a social force; men of letters reach public affairs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_782">As new roads to achieve power are found, however, we see the value of birth fall. In the XIth century, nobility had an inestimable value; it is purchased <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>8<span class="bracket">]</span></span> in the XIIIth; the first granting of nobility takes place in 1270,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt367" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt367_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a> and equality is finally introduced into government by aristocracy itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_783">During the seven hundred years that have just passed, it sometimes happened that, in order to struggle against royal authority, or to take power away from their rivals, the nobles gave political power to the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_784">Even more often, you saw kings make the lower classes of the State participate in government in order to humble<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt368" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt368_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> the aristocracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_785">In France, kings showed themselves to be the most active and most constant of levelers. When they were ambitious and strong, they worked to raise the people to the level of the nobles, and when they were moderate and weak, they allowed<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt369" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt369_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a> the people to put themselves above kings. The former helped democracy by their talents, the latter by their vices. Louis XI and Louis XIV took care to equalize everything below the throne, and Louis XV himself finally descended into the dust with his court.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt370" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt370_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_786">As soon as citizens began to own the land in ways other than by feudal tenure, and as soon as personal wealth, once known, could in turn create influence and confer power, no discoveries were made in the arts, no further <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>9<span class="bracket">]</span></span> improvements were introduced into commerce and industry, without also creating as many new elements of equality among men. From this moment, all processes that are found, all needs that are born, all desires that demand to be satisfied, are progress toward universal leveling. The taste for luxury, the love of war, the sway of fashion, the most superficial passions of the human heart as well as the most profound, seem to work in concert to impoverish the rich and to enrich the poor.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_787">From the time when works of the mind became sources of strength and wealth, each development of science, each new element of knowledge, each new idea had to be considered as a germ of power put within reach of the people. Poetry, eloquence, memory, mental graces, fires of the imagination, depth of thought, all these gifts that heaven distributes at random, profited democracy, and even when they were in the possession of democracy’s adversaries, they still served its cause by putting into relief the natural grandeur of man; so democracy’s conquests spread with those of civilization and enlightenment, and literature was an arsenal open to all, where the weak and the poor came each day to find arms.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_788">When you skim the pages of our history you do not find so to speak any great events that for seven hundred years have not turned to the profit of equality.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_789">The Crusades and the English wars decimate the nobles and divide their lands; the institution of the towns introduces democratic liberty into the feudal monarchy; [&lt;the rigors enforced against the Jews bring about the invention of paper wealth<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt371" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt371_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a>&gt;]; the discovery of firearms equalizes the villein and the noble on the field of battle; printing offers equal resources to their minds; the post comes to deposit enlightenment at the threshold of the hut of the poor as at the gate of palaces; Protestantism maintains that all men are equally able to find the way to heaven. America, which comes into sight, presents a thousand new paths to fortune and delivers the wealth and power [reserved to kings] to obscure adventurers.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_790">If you examine what is happening in France from the XIth century every <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>10<span class="bracket">]</span></span> fifty years, at the end of each one of these periods, you will not fail to notice that a double revolution has taken place in the state of society. The noble will have slipped on the social ladder, the commoner will have risen; the one descends, the other ascends. Each half-century brings them closer together, and soon they are going to touch.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_791">And this is not only particular to France. In whatever direction we cast our eyes, we notice the same revolution continuing in all of the Christian universe. [Let someone cite to me a republic or a kingdom in which the nobles of today can be compared, I would not say to the nobles of feudal times, but only to their fathers of the last century. {If France hastened the democratic revolution of which I am speaking, France did not give it birth}.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_792">For seven hundred years, there is not a single event among Christians that has not turned to the profit of democracy, not a man who has not served its triumph. &lt;≠The clergy by spreading enlightenment and by applying within its bosom the principle of Christian equality, kings by opposing the people to nobles, nobles by opposing the people to kings; writers and the learned by creating intellectual riches for democracy’s use; tradesmen by providing unknown resources for democracy’s activity; the navigator by finding democracy new worlds.≠&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_793">Everywhere you saw the various incidents in the lives of peoples turn to the profit of democracy; all men aided it by their efforts:<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt372" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt372_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a> those who had in view contributing to its success and those who did not think of serving it; those who fought for it and even those who declared themselves its enemies; all were pushed pell-mell along the same path, and all worked in common, some despite themselves, others without their knowledge, blind instruments in the hands of God.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_794">So the gradual development of equality of conditions [{democracy}] is a providential fact;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt373" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt373_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a> it has the principal characteristics of one: it is universal, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>11<span class="bracket">]</span></span> <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>12<span class="bracket">]</span></span> it is lasting, it escapes every day from human power; all events, like all men, serve its development.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt374" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt374_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>13<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_795">Would it be wise to believe that a social movement that comes from so far could be suspended by the efforts of a generation?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt375" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt375_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a> Do you think that <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>14<span class="bracket">]</span></span> after having destroyed feudalism and vanquished kings, democracy will retreat before the bourgeois and the rich?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt376" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt376_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a> Will it stop now that it has become so strong and its adversaries so weak?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_796">So where are we going? No one can say; for we are already lacking terms of comparison; conditions are more equal today among Christians than they have ever been in any time or in any country in the world; thus we are prevented by the magnitude of what is already done from foreseeing what can still be done.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_797">The entire book that you are about to read has been written under the impression of a sort of religious terror produced in the soul of the author by the sight of this irresistible revolution that has marched for so many centuries over all obstacles, and that we still see today advancing amid the ruins that it has made.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_798">It isn’t necessary for God himself to speak in order for us to discover sure signs of his will; it is enough to examine the regular march of nature and the continuous tendency of events; I know, without the Creator raising his voice, that the stars in space follow the curves traced by his fingers.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_799">If long observations and sincere meditations led men of today to recognize that the gradual and progressive development of equality is at once the past and the future of their history, this discovery alone would give this development the sacred character of the will of God. To want to stop democracy would then seem to be struggling against God himself, and it would only remain for nations to accommodate themselves to the social state that Providence imposes on them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt377" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt377_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>15<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_800">Christian peoples seem to me to offer today a frightening spectacle.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt378" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt378_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a> The movement that sweeps them along is already so strong that it cannot be suspended, and it is not yet so rapid as to despair of directing it. Their fate is in their hands; but soon it escapes them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt379" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt379_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>16<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_801">To instruct democracy, to revive its beliefs if possible, to purify its mores, to regulate its movements, to substitute little by little the science of public affairs for its inexperience, knowledge of its true interests for its blind instincts; to adapt its government to times and places; to modify it according to circumstances and men; such is the first of duties imposed today on those who lead society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_802">A new political science<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt380" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt380_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a> is needed for a world entirely new<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt381" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt381_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a> [{for a unique situation, laws without precedents are needed}].</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>17<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_803">But that is what we scarcely consider; placed in the middle of a rapid river, we obstinately fix our eyes on some debris that we still see on the bank, while the current carries us away and pushes us backwards toward the abyss.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_804">There is no people of Europe among whom the great social revolution<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt382" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt382_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a> that I have just described has made more rapid progress than among us; but here it has always marched haphazardly.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_805">The heads of State [{legislator}] never thought to prepare anything in advance for it; it came about despite them or without their knowledge. The most powerful, most intelligent and most moral classes of the nation did <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>18<span class="bracket">]</span></span> not try to take hold of it in order to direct it. So democracy has been abandoned to its wild instincts; it has grown up like those children, deprived of paternal care, who raise themselves in the streets of our cities, and who know society only by its vices and miseries. We still seemed unaware of its existence, when it took hold of power without warning. Then each person submitted with servility to its slightest desires; it was adored as the image of strength; when later it was weakened by its own excesses, legislators conceived the imprudent plan of destroying it instead of trying to instruct and correct it, and not wanting to teach it to govern, they thought only about pushing it away from government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_806">The result was that the democratic revolution took place in the material aspect of society without happening in the laws, ideas, habits and mores,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt383" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt383_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a> the change that would have been necessary to make this revolution<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt384" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt384_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>19<span class="bracket">]</span></span> useful. We therefore have democracy, minus what must attenuate its vices and bring out its natural advantages; and seeing already the evils that it brings, we are still unaware of the good that it can give.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_807">When royal power, supported by the aristocracy, peacefully governed the peoples of Europe, society, amid its miseries, enjoyed several kinds of happiness, which are difficult to imagine and appreciate today.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_808">The power of some subjects raised insurmountable barriers to the tyranny of the prince; and kings, feeling vested in the eyes of the crowd with a nearly divine character, drew, from the very respect that they caused, the will not to abuse their power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_809">Placed an immense distance from the people, the nobles nonetheless took the type of benevolent and tranquil interest in the fate of the people that the shepherd<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt385" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt385_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> gives to his flock; and without seeing the poor man as their equal, they watched over his lot as a trust put in their hands by Providence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_810">Not having conceived the idea of a social state other than their own, not imagining that they could ever be equal to their rulers, the people accepted the benefits and did not question the rights of their rulers. They loved them when they were lenient and just and submitted without difficulty and without servility to their rigors as to inevitable evils sent to them by the hand of God. Custom and mores had, moreover, established limits to tyranny and founded a kind of right in the very midst of force.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_811">Since the noble did not think that someone would want to wrest from him the privileges that he believed legitimate, and the serf regarded his <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>20<span class="bracket">]</span></span> inferiority as a result of the immutable order of nature, it is conceivable that a kind of reciprocal benevolence could be established between these two classes sharing so different a fate. You then saw in society inequality, miseries, but souls were not degraded.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_812">It is not the use of power or the habit of obedience that depraves men; it is the use of a power that they consider as illegitimate and obedience to a power that they regard as usurped and oppressive.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_813">On one side were wealth, force, leisure and with them the pursuit of luxury, refinements of taste, pleasures of the mind, devotion to the arts; on the other, work, coarseness and ignorance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_814">But within this ignorant and coarse crowd, you met energetic passions, generous sentiments, profound beliefs and untamed virtues.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_815">The social body organized in this way could have stability, power, and above all glory.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_816">But ranks are merging; barriers raised between men are falling; estates are being divided; power is being shared, enlightenment is spreading, intellects are becoming equal; the social state is becoming democratic, and the dominion of democracy is finally being established peacefully in institutions and in mores.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_817">Then I imagine a society where all, seeing the law as their work, would love it and would submit to it without difficulty; where since the authority of the government is respected as necessary and not as divine, the love that is felt for the head of State would be not a passion, but a reasoned and calm sentiment. Since each person has rights and is assured of preserving his rights, a manly confidence and a kind of reciprocal condescension, as far from pride as from servility, would be established among all classes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_818">Instructed in their true interests, the people would understand that, in order to take advantage of the good things of society, you must submit to its burdens. The free association of citizens would then be able to replace the individual power of the nobles, and the State would be sheltered from tyranny and from license.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_819">I understand that in a democratic State, constituted in this manner, society will not be immobile; but the movements of the social body will be <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>21<span class="bracket">]</span></span> able to be regulated and progressive; if you meet less brilliance there than within an aristocracy, you will find less misery; pleasures will be less extreme and well-being more general; knowledge not as great and ignorance more rare; sentiments less energetic and habits more mild; there you will notice more vices and fewer crimes.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt386" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt386_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_820">If there is no enthusiasm and fervor of beliefs, enlightenment and experience will sometimes obtain great sacrifices from citizens; each man, equally weak, will feel an equal need for his fellows; and knowing that he can gain their support only on condition of lending them his help, he will discover without difficulty that for him particular interest merges with the general interest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_821">The nation taken as a body will be less brilliant, less glorious, less strong perhaps; but the majority of citizens there will enjoy a more prosperous lot, and the people will appear untroubled, not because they despair of being better, but because they know they are well-off.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt387" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt387_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_822">If everything was not good and useful in such an order of things, society at least would have appropriated everything useful and good that such an order can present; and men, while abandoning forever the social advantages that aristocracy can provide, would have taken from democracy all the good that the latter can offer to them.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>22<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_823">But we, while giving up the social state of our ancestors, while throwing pell-mell their institutions, their ideas, and their mores behind us, what have we put in their place?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_824">The prestige of royal power has vanished, without being replaced by the majesty of laws; today the people scorn authority, but they fear it, and fear extracts more from them than respect and love formerly yielded.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_825">I notice that we have destroyed the individual existences that could struggle separately against tyranny [{but I do not see that we have created a collective strength to fulfill their function}], but I see the government that alone inherits all the prerogatives wrenched from families, from corporations or from men; so, to the sometimes oppressive but often conservative strength of a small number of citizens, the weakness of all has succeeded.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_826">The division of fortunes has reduced the distance that separated the poor from the rich; but by coming closer together, they seem to have found new reasons to hate each other, and, eyeing one another with looks full of terror and envy, they mutually push each other away from power; for the one as for the other, the idea of rights does not exist, and force appears to them both as the only reason for the present and the sole guarantee of the future.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_827">The poor man has kept most of the prejudices of his fathers, without their beliefs; their ignorance, without their virtues; he has accepted, as the rule for his actions, the doctrine of interest, without knowing the science of interest, and his egoism is as wanting in enlightenment as his devotion formerly was.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_828">Society is tranquil, not because it is conscious of its strength and its well-being, but on the contrary because it believes itself weak and frail; it is afraid of dying by making an effort. Everyone feels that things are going badly, but no one has the necessary courage and energy to seek something better; we have desires, regrets, sorrows and joys that produce nothing visible or lasting, similar to the passions of old men that end in impotence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_829">Thus we have abandoned what the old state could present of the good, without acquiring what the current state would be able to offer of the useful; we have destroyed an aristocratic society, [and we do not think about organizing on its ruins a moral and tranquil democracy] and, stopping out <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>23<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of complacency amid the debris of the former edifice, we seem to want to settle there forever.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt388" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt388_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_830">What is happening in the intellectual world is no less deplorable.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>24<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_831">Hindered in its march or abandoned without support to its disorderly passions, democracy in France has overturned everything that it met on its way, weakening what it did not destroy. You did not see it take hold of society little by little in order to establish its dominion peacefully; it has not ceased to march amid the disorders and the agitation of battle. Animated by the heat of the struggle, pushed beyond the natural limits of his opinion by the opinions and excesses of his adversaries, each person loses sight of the very object of his pursuits and uses a language that corresponds badly to his true sentiments and to his secret instincts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_832">From that results the strange confusion that we are forced to witness.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_833">I search my memory in vain; I find nothing that deserves to excite more distress and more pity than what is happening before our eyes;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt389" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt389_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a> it seems that today we have broken the natural bond that unites opinions to tastes and actions to beliefs; the sympathy that has been observed in all times between the sentiments and the ideas of men seems to be destroyed, and you would say that all the laws of moral analogy are abolished.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_834">You still meet among us Christians full of zeal, whose religious souls love to be nourished by the truths of the other life; they are undoubtedly going to become active in favor of human liberty, source of all moral grandeur. [&lt;Their hearts will open without difficulty to the holy love of country, this religion of the political world so fruitful in generous devotions.&gt;] Christianity, which has made all men equal before God, will not be loath to see all citizens equal before the law. But, by a combination of strange events, religion is at the moment involved amid the powers that democracy is overturning, and it often happens that religion rejects the equality that it loves and curses liberty as an adversary, while, by taking liberty by the hand, religion could be able to sanctify its efforts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_835">Next to these religious men, I find others whose sights are turned toward the earth rather than toward heaven; partisans of liberty, not only because <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>25<span class="bracket">]</span></span> they see in it the origin of the most noble virtues, but above all because they consider it as the source of the greatest advantages, they sincerely desire to secure its dominion and to have men taste its benefits. I understand that the latter are going to hasten to call religion to their aid, for they must know that you cannot establish the reign of liberty without that of mores, nor found mores without beliefs; but they have seen religion in the ranks of their adversaries; that is enough for them; some attack religion and the others dare not defend it [all lack enlightenment or courage].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_836">Past centuries saw base and venal souls advocate slavery, while independent spirits and generous hearts struggled without hope to save human liberty. But today you often meet men naturally noble and proud whose opinions are in direct opposition to their tastes, and who speak in praise of the servility and baseness that they have never known for themselves. There are others, in contrast, who speak of liberty as if they could feel what is holy and great in it and who loudly claim on behalf of humanity rights that they have always disregarded.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_837">I notice virtuous and peaceful men placed naturally by their pure morals, tranquil habits, prosperity and enlightenment at the head of the populations that surround them. Full of a sincere love of country, they are ready to make great sacrifices for it. Civilization, however, often finds them to be adversaries; they confuse its abuses with its benefits, and in their minds the idea of evil is indissolubly united with the idea of the new [and they seem to want to establish a monstrous bond between virtue, misery and ignorance so that all three may be struck with the same blow<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt390" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt390_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a>].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_838">Nearby I see other men who, in the name of progress, try hard to materialize man, wanting to find the useful without attending to the just, wanting <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>26<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to find knowledge far from beliefs and well-being separate from virtue. These claim to be champions of modern civilization and they arrogantly put themselves at its head, usurping a place that is abandoned to them and that their unworthiness denies to them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt391" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt391_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_839">So where are we?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_840">Religious men combat liberty, and the friends of liberty attack religion; noble and generous spirits speak in praise of slavery, and base and servile souls advocate independence; honest and enlightened citizens are enemies of all progress, while men without patriotism and without mores become the apostles of civilization and enlightenment!</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_841">Have all centuries resembled ours then? Has man always had before his eyes, as today, a world where nothing is connected, where virtue is without genius,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt392" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt392_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> and genius without honor; where love of order merges with the taste for tyrants and the holy cult of liberty with scorn for human laws; where conscience throws only a doubtful light upon human actions; where nothing any longer seems either forbidden, or permitted, or honest, or shameful, or true, or false?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_842">Will I think that the Creator made man in order to leave him to struggle endlessly amid the intellectual miseries that surround us? I cannot believe it; God is preparing for European societies a future more settled and more calm; I do not know his plans, but I will not cease to believe in them because I cannot fathom them, and I will prefer to doubt my knowledge than his justice.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_843">There is a country in the world where the great social revolution that I am speaking about seems more or less to have reached its natural limits; it came about there in a simple and easy way, or rather it can be said that this <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>27<span class="bracket">]</span></span> country sees the results of the democratic revolution that is taking place among us, without having had the revolution itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_844">The emigrants who came to settle in America at the beginning of the XVIIth century in a way freed the principle of democracy from all those principles that it struggled against within the old societies of Europe, and they transplanted it alone to the shores of the New World. There it was able to grow in liberty and, moving ahead with mores, to develop peacefully in the laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_845">It seems to me beyond doubt that sooner or later, we will arrive, like the Americans, at a nearly complete equality of conditions. From that, I do not conclude that one day we are necessarily called to draw from such a social state the political consequences that the Americans have drawn from it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt393" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt393_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a> I am very far from believing that they have found the only form of government that democracy may take; but in the two countries the generating cause of laws and mores is the same; that is enough for us to have an immense interest in knowing what that generating cause has produced in each of them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_846">So it is not only to satisfy a curiosity, legitimate for that matter, that I examined America; I wanted to find lessons there from which we would be <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>28<span class="bracket">]</span></span> able to profit. You would be strangely mistaken if you thought that I wanted to do a panegyric; whoever reads this book will be clearly convinced that such was not my purpose;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt394" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt394_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a> nor was my goal to advocate any particular form of government in general; for I am among those who believe that there is hardly ever absolute good in laws; I did not even claim to judge if the social revolution, whose march seems irresistible to me, was advantageous or harmful to humanity. I have acknowledged this revolution as an accomplished or nearly accomplished fact, and, from among the peoples who have seen it taking place among them, I sought the people among whom it has reached the most complete and most peaceful development, in order to discern clearly its natural consequences and, if possible, to see the means to make it profitable to men. I admit that in America I saw more than America;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt395" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt395_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a> I sought there an image of democracy itself, its tendencies, its character, its prejudices, its passions; I wanted to know democracy, if only to know at least what we must hope or fear from it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_847">In the first part of this work, I tried to show the direction that democracy, delivered in America to its tendencies and abandoned almost without constraint <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>29<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to its instincts, gave naturally to laws, the course that it imparted to government, and in general the power that it gained over public affairs. I wanted to know what good and bad it produced. I sought out what precautions the Americans have used to direct it and what others they have omitted, and I undertook to discern the causes that allow it to govern society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_848">My goal was to portray in a second part [{third volume}] the influence that equality of conditions and the government of democracy exercise in America on civil society, on habits, ideas and mores;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt396" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt396_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a> but I begin to feel less enthusiasm<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt397" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt397_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a> about accomplishing this plan. Before I can complete in this way the task that I proposed for myself, my work will have become nearly useless. Someone else will soon show readers the principal features of the American character and, hiding the seriousness of the descriptions behind a light veil, will lend truth charms with which I would not be able to adorn it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt398" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt398_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>30<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_849">I do not know if I have succeeded in making known what I saw in America, but I am sure that I sincerely desired to do so, and that I never yielded, except unknowingly, to the need to adapt facts to ideas, instead of subjecting ideas to facts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_850">When a point could be established with the help of written documents, I have taken care to turn to original texts and to the most authentic and most respected works.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt400" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt400_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> I have indicated my sources in notes, and everyone will be able to verify them. When it was a matter of opinions, of political customs, of observations of mores, I sought to consult the most enlightened men. If something happened to be important or doubtful, I was not content with one witness, but decided only on the basis of the body of testimonies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_851">Here the reader must necessarily take me at my word. I would often have been able to cite in support of what I advance the authority of names that are known to him, or that at least are worthy to be; but I have refrained from doing so. The stranger often learns by the hearth of his host important truths, that the latter would perhaps conceal from a friend; with the stranger you ease the burden of a forced silence; you are not afraid of his indiscretion because he is passing through. Each one of these confidences was recorded by me as soon as received, but they will never emerge from my manuscripts; I prefer to detract from the success of my accounts than to add my name <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>31<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to the list of those travelers who send sorrows and troubles in return for the generous hospitality that they received.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_852">I know that, despite my care, nothing will be easier than to criticize this book, if anyone ever thinks to examine it critically.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_853">Those who will want to look closely at it will find, I think, in the entire work, a generative thought that links so to speak all its parts. But the diversity of the subjects that I had to treat is very great, and whoever will undertake to contrast an isolated fact to the whole of the facts that I cite, a detached idea to the whole of the ideas, will succeed without difficulty. So I would like you to grant me the favor of reading me with the same spirit that presided over my work, and would like you to judge this book by the general impression that it leaves, as I myself came to a decision, not due to a particular reason, but due to the mass of reasons.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_854">Nor must it be forgotten that the author who wants to make himself understood is obliged to push each of his ideas to all of their theoretical consequences, and often to the limits of what is false and impractical;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt402" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt402_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a> for if it is sometimes necessary to step back from the rules of logic in actions, you cannot do the same in discourses, and man finds it almost as difficult to be inconsistent in his words as he normally finds it to be consistent in his actions. [&lt;This, to say in passing, brings out one of the great advantages of free governments, an advantage about which you scarcely think. In these <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>32<span class="bracket">]</span></span> governments, it is necessary to talk a great deal. The need to talk forces men of State to reason, and from speeches a bit of logic is introduced into public affairs.&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_855">I finish by pointing out myself what a great number of readers<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt403" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt403_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a> will consider as the capital defect of the work.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt404" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt404_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a> This book follows in no one’s train exactly; by writing it I did not mean either to serve or to combat any party; I set about to see, not differently, but farther than parties;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt405" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt405_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a> and while they are concerned with the next day, I wanted to think about the future.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt406" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt406_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_857">North America, in its exterior configuration, presents general features that are easy to distinguish at first glance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_858">A kind of methodical order presided over the separation of land and waterways, mountains and valleys. A simple and majestic arrangement is revealed even in the midst of the confusion of objects and among the extreme variety of scenes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_859">Two vast regions divide North America almost equally.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt407" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt407_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">*</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_860">One is limited, in the North, by the Arctic pole; in the East, in the West, by the two great oceans. Then it advances southward and forms a triangle whose sides, irregularly drawn, finally meet below the Great Lakes of Canada.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>34<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_861">The second begins where the first finishes and extends over the entire remainder of the continent.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_862">The one inclines slightly toward the pole; the other, toward the equator.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_863">The lands included in the first region descend toward the north in a slope so slight that they could almost be said to form a plateau. In the interior of this immense flatland, there are neither high mountains nor deep valleys.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_864">There the waterways wind as if haphazardly. The rivers mingle, join together, part, meet again, vanish in a thousand swamps, are lost continually within a watery labyrinth that they have created, and only after in numerable twists and turns do they finally reach the polar seas. The Great Lakes, where this first region terminates, are not, like most of the lakes of the Old World, steeply embanked by hills and rocks; their shores are flat and rise only a few feet above sea level. So each of them forms something like a vast basin filled to the brim: the slightest changes in the structure of the globe would hurl their waters toward either the pole or the tropical sea.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_865">The second region is more uneven and better prepared to become the permanent dwelling place of man; two long mountain ranges divide it along its length: one, named the Allegheny Mountains, follows the shores of the Atlantic Ocean; the other parallels the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_866">The space enclosed between these two mountain ranges includes 228,843 square leagues.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt408" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt408_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> So its area is about six times greater than that of France.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt410" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt410_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_867">Yet this vast territory forms only a single valley that descends from the rounded summits of the Allegheny Mountains, and, without meeting any obstacles, climbs again to the peaks of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_868">At the bottom of the valley flows an immense river. From all directions, waterways descending from the mountains are seen to rush toward it.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>35<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_869">Formerly the French called it the Saint Louis River, in memory of the absent homeland; and the Indians, in their pompous language, named it the Father of Waters, or the Mississippi.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_870">The Mississippi has its source at the boundaries of the two great regions that I spoke about above, near the top of the plateau that separates them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_871">Near the source of the Mississippi another river<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt411" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt411_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> arises that empties into the polar seas. Sometimes even the Mississippi seems uncertain of the path it should take; several times it retraces its steps, and only after slowing its pace amidst lakes and marshes does it finally settle upon its route and set its course slowly toward the south.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_872">Sometimes calm within the clayey bed that nature has dug for it, sometimes swollen by storms, the Mississippi waters more than a thousand leagues along its way.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt412" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt412_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_873">Six hundred leagues<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt413" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt413_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> above its mouth, the river already has an average depth of 15 feet, and vessels of 300 tons go up for a distance of nearly two hundred leagues.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_874">Fifty-seven large navigable rivers flow into it. The tributaries of the Mississippi include a river with a length of 1,300 leagues,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt414" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt414_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> one of 900,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt415" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt415_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a> one of 600,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt416" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt416_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a> one of 500,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt417" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt417_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">9</a> four of 200,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt418" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt418_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">10</a> without considering an innumerable multitude of streams that rush from all directions to become lost within it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_875">The valley watered by the Mississippi seems to have been created for it alone; there the river dispenses good and evil at will, and seems like a god. Near the river, nature displays an inexhaustible fecundity. As you move away from its banks, plant energies fail; the soil thins; everything languishes <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>36<span class="bracket">]</span></span> or dies. Nowhere have the great convulsions of the earth left clearer traces than in the Mississippi Valley. The whole appearance of the country attests to the action of water. Its sterility, like its abundance, is the work of water. At the bottom of the valley, the waves of the early ocean built up huge layers of vegetable matter and then wore them down over time. On the right bank of the river you find immense plains, made smooth like the surface of a field worked over by the farmworker’s roller. In contrast, the closer you get to the mountains, the more and more broken and sterile the ground becomes; the soil is pierced, so to speak, in a thousand places; and here and there primitive rocks appear, like the bones of a skeleton after time has consumed the surrounding muscles and flesh. Granite sand and stones of irregular size cover the surface of the earth; the shoots of a few plants grow with great difficulty among these obstacles; it seems like a fertile field covered by the ruins of some vast edifice. By analyzing these stones and this sand, it is in fact easy to notice a perfect analogy between their materials and those that form the dry and broken peaks of the Rocky Mountains. After pushing the earth headlong into the bottom of the valley, the water almost certainly ended up carrying along a portion of the rocks themselves; it rolled them along the nearest slopes; and, after grinding them against each other, it scattered these fragments, torn from the summits, at the base of the mountains.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt419" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt419_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> <a href="#n001" id="n001_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">A</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_876">All in all, the Mississippi Valley is the most magnificent dwelling place ever prepared by God for human habitation;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt420" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt420_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> and yet, it can be said that it is still only a vast wilderness.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt421" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt421_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_877">On the eastern slope of the Allegheny Mountains, between the foot of the mountains and the Atlantic Ocean, stretches a long band of rocks and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>37<span class="bracket">]</span></span> sand that the sea seems to have forgotten as it withdrew. This territory is, on average, only 48 leagues wide,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt422" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt422_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">11</a> but it is 390 leagues long.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt423" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt423_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">12</a> The soil, in this part of the American continent, lends itself to cultivation only with difficulty. Vegetation there is sparse and uniform.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_878">On this inhospitable coast the efforts of human industry were first concentrated. On this strip of arid land were born and grew the English colonies, which would one day become the United States of America. Still today the center of power is found there, while behind, almost in secret, gather the true elements of a great people to whom the future of the continent no doubt belongs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_879">When Europeans landed on the shores of the Antilles and later on the coasts of South America, they thought themselves transported into the fabled regions celebrated by poets.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt424" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt424_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> The sea sparkled with the fiery glow of the tropics.

In these enchanted places, all that came into view seemed prepared for the needs of man or planned for his pleasures. Most of the trees were laden with nourishing fruits, and those least useful to man charmed his vision with the vividness and variety of their colors. In a forest of fragrant lemon trees, of wild figs, of myrtle oaks, of acacias and of oleanders, all intertwined by flowering creepers, a multitude of birds unknown in Europe flashed their wings of crimson and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>38<span class="bracket">]</span></span> azure and mingled the chorus of their songs with the harmonies of a nature full of movement and life.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt426" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt426_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> <a href="#n002" id="n002_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">B</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_880">Death was hidden under this brilliant cloak; but it was not noticed at all at that time. Moreover, in the air of these regions, there reigned I do not know what enervating influence, attaching man to the present and rendering him unmindful of the future.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_881">North America presented another appearance; everything there was grave, serious, solemn. You could have said that it had been created to become the domain of the mind, as the other was to be the dwelling place of the senses.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_882">A turbulent and foggy ocean enveloped its coasts; granite rocks or sandy shores girdled it; the forests that covered its banks displayed a somber and melancholy foliage; hardly anything other than pine, larch, holm oak, wild olive and laurel grew there.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_883">After penetrating this first barrier, people entered into the shade of the central forest; there the largest trees that grow in the two hemispheres were found mixed together. The plane tree, catalpa, sugar maple, and Virginia poplar [eastern poplar]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt427" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt427_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> intertwined their branches with those of the oak, the beech and the linden.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_884">As in forests subjected to the dominion of man, death struck here without respite; but no one took responsibility for clearing the remains that death had caused. So they piled up; time could not reduce them to dust <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>39<span class="bracket">]</span></span> quickly enough to prepare new places. But in the very midst of these remains, the work of reproduction went on without ceasing. Climbing plants and weeds of all types grew up through the obstacles; they crept along the fallen tree trunks, wormed into their dust, lifted up and broke the withered bark that still covered them, and cleared a path for their young offshoots. Thus, in a way, death there came to the aid of life. They were face to face, and seemed to want to mix and mingle their work.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt428" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt428_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_885">These forests concealed a profound darkness. A thousand small streams, not yet channeled by human effort, maintained an unending humidity. Scarcely any flowers, wild fruits, or any birds were seen.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_886">Only the fall of a tree toppled by age, the cataract of a river, the bellowing of the buffalo and the whistling of the winds disturbed the silence of nature.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt429" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt429_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_887">East of the great river, the woods partially disappeared; in their place spread limitless prairies. Had nature, in its infinite variety, denied the seeds of trees to these fertile fields, or had the forest that once covered them been destroyed long ago by the hand of man? This is something that neither tradition nor scientific research has been able to discover.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_888">These immense wilderness areas were not entirely without the presence of man however; for centuries, a few small tribes wandered in the shade of the forest or across the prairie lands. From the mouth of the Saint Lawrence to the delta of the Mississippi, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, these savages shared certain similarities that testified to their common origin. But they also differed from all known races.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt430" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt430_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">14</a> They were neither white like the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>40<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Europeans, nor yellow like most of the Asians, nor black like the Negroes. Their skin was reddish; their hair, long and lustrous; their lips, thin; and their cheekbones, very prominent. The languages spoken by the savage tribes of America differed from each other in words, but all were bound by the same grammatical rules. On several points, these rules deviated from those that, until then, had seemed to govern the formation of human language.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_889">The idiom of the Americans seemed to result from new combinations; it indicated on the part of its inventors an exercise of intelligence of which the Indians of today seem little capable.<a href="#n003" id="n003_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">C</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_890">The social state of these peoples also differed in several respects from what was seen in the Old World: it could have been said that they multiplied freely in their wilderness, without contact with more civilized races. So among them, you found none of those doubtful and incoherent notions of good and evil, none of that profound corruption which is usually combined with ignorance and crudeness of mores among civilized nations who have descended into barbarism again. The Indian owed nothing to anyone except himself. His virtues, his vices, his prejudices were his own work; he grew up in the wild independence of his own nature.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_891">The coarseness of common men, in civilized countries, comes not only from their ignorance and poverty, but also from their daily contact, as ignorant and poor men, with those who are enlightened and rich.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_892">The sight of their misfortune and weakness, which is in daily contrast to the good fortune and power of certain of their fellows, excites anger and fear simultaneously in their heart; the feeling of their inferiority and dependence irritates and humiliates them. This inner state of soul is reproduced in their mores, as well as in their language; at the very same time, they are insolent and servile.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>41<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_893">The truth of this is easily proved by observation. The people are more coarse in aristocratic countries than anywhere else, and in opulent cities more than in the countryside.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt431" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt431_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_894">In these places, where men so rich and powerful are found, the weak and poor feel as though overwhelmed by their low condition; finding no point by which they can regain equality, they completely lose hope in themselves and allow themselves to fall below the dignity of human nature.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_895">This unfortunate effect of the contrast in conditions is not found in savage life; the Indians, at the same time that they are all ignorant and poor, are all equal and free.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt432" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt432_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_896">At the time of the arrival of the Europeans, the native of North America was still unaware of the value of wealth and showed himself indifferent to the material well-being that civilized man obtains from it. He exhibited no coarseness however; on the contrary, an habitual reserve and a kind of aristocratic courtesy governed the way he behaved.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_897">In peace, mild and hospitable, in war, merciless even beyond the known limits of human ferocity, the Indian risked death by starvation in order to aid a stranger who knocked at night on the door of his hut and, with his own hands, tore apart the quivering limbs of his prisoner. The most famous republics of antiquity never admired firmer courage, prouder souls, a more uncompromising love of independence than what was then hidden in the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>42<span class="bracket">]</span></span> wild forests of the New World.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt433" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt433_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">15</a> The Europeans made only a small impression when landing on the shores of North America; their presence gave rise to neither envy nor fear. What hold could they have over such men? The Indian knew how to live without needs, how to suffer without complaint, and how to die singing.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt434" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt434_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">16</a> Like all the other members of the great human family, moreover, these savages believed in the existence of a better world, and under different names worshipped God, creator of the universe. Their notions about the great intellectual truths were generally simple and philosophical.<a href="#n004" id="n004_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">D</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>43<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_898">Yet, no matter how primitive the people whose character we are describing may appear, it cannot be doubted that they had been preceded in the same regions by another people, more civilized and advanced in all ways.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_899">An obscure tradition, but one widespread among most of the Indian tribes along the Atlantic coast, teaches us that long ago the dwelling place of these very bands was located west of the Mississippi. Mounds raised by human hands are still found every day along the banks of the Ohio and throughout the central valley. We are told that when you dig into the center of these monuments, you hardly ever fail to find human bones, strange instruments, weapons, implements of all sorts that are made of a metal or that recall uses unknown to the present races.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt436" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt436_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_900">The Indians of today can give no information at all about the history of this unknown people. Nor did those who lived three hundred years ago, at the time of the discovery of America, say anything from which even an hypothesis could be inferred. Traditions, those perishable and constantly recurring memorials of the primitive world, furnish no light whatsoever. It cannot be doubted, however, that thousands of people similar to us lived there. When did they come there; what was their origin, their destiny, their history? When and how did they perish? No one could say.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_901">Strange thing! Some peoples have so completely disappeared from the earth that even the memory of their name has been blotted out; their languages are lost; their glory has faded like a sound without an echo. But I do not know if there is even one who has not at least left one tomb to mark its passage. Thus, of all the works of man, the most durable is still the one that best recounts his nothingness and his woes!</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_902">Although the vast country just described was inhabited by numerous tribes of natives, you could justly say that, at the time of discovery, it was still only a wilderness. The Indians occupied, but did not possess it. Man appropriates the soil by agriculture, and the first inhabitants of North America lived by the hunt. Their implacable prejudices, their untamed passions, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>44<span class="bracket">]</span></span> their vices, and perhaps even more their wild virtues delivered them to an inevitable destruction. The ruin of these people began the day Europeans landed on their shores; it has continued constantly since then; today it reaches completion. Providence, while placing them in the midst of the riches of the New World, seemed to have given them only a short usufruct; in a way, these people were there only <span class="ital">waiting.</span> These coasts, so well prepared for commerce and industry; these rivers, so deep; this inexhaustible Mississippi Valley; this entire continent, appeared at that time as the still empty cradle of a great nation.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt437" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt437_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_903">That is where civilized men had to try to build society on new foundations. Applying, for the first time, theories until then unknown or considered inapplicable, civilized men were going to present a spectacle for which past history had not prepared the world.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt438" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt438_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_905">A man is newly born; his first years pass obscurely amid the pleasures or occupations of childhood.

Then, for the first time, you study him and think that the seeds of the vices and virtues of his mature years can be seen developing in him.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt440" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt440_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_906">If I am not mistaken, that is a great error.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt441" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt441_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_907">Go back to the beginning; examine the child even in the arms of his mother; see the exterior world reflected for the first time in the still dark mirror of his intellect; contemplate the first examples that catch his eye; listen to the first words that awaken his slumbering powers of thought; finally, witness the first struggles that he has to sustain. And only then will you understand the origin of the prejudices, the habits and the passions that are going to dominate his life. The whole man is there, so to speak, in the infant swaddled in his cradle.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_908">Something similar happens among nations. Peoples always feel the effects of their origin. The circumstances that accompanied their birth and were useful to their development influence all the rest of their course.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_909">If it were possible for us to go back to the elements of societies and examine the first memorials of their history, I am certain that we would be able to discover there the first cause of the prejudices, habits, dominant passions, of all that ultimately composes what is called the national character. [{There, no doubt, we would find the key to more than one historical enigma}]. There we would happen to find the explanation for customs that today seem contrary to the reigning mores; for laws that seem opposed to recognized principles; for incoherent opinions found here and there in society like fragments of broken chains that are sometimes seen still hanging <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>47<span class="bracket">]</span></span> from the vaults of an old edifice and that no longer hold up anything. Thus would be explained the destiny of certain peoples who seem to be dragged by an unknown force toward an end unknown even to themselves. But until now facts have been lacking for such a study. The spirit of analysis came to nations only as they grew older, and when, at last, they thought to contemplate their birth, time had already enveloped it in a mist; ignorance and pride had surrounded it with fables that hid the truth.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_910">[Human remains are said to volatilize after death. Separated from each other, these human molecules are incorporated with other living substances. Each of us can therefore consider himself as the summary of many other individuals of the same species who have lived before him. An analogous phenomenon occurs again in the history of the formation of peoples. Moreover, since the time when the various human races began to succeed one another and to graft together, what people of the Old World is not today composed of the remnants of older nations? It is true that, in place of peoples who have ceased to exist, we have seen new peoples arise who have borrowed something from each of their precursors. From this one, its tongue; from that one, its laws; from another, its mores; from a fourth, certain opinions and prejudices. Because these elements already exist, only their combination is new. Amid all this debris of societies that slides haphazardly over the earth, there is no one who could now recapture an original type, or who would dare to trace how time has subjected an original type to changes by combining it with strange elements. Science, in such a labyrinth, provides only incomplete conclusions and vague hypotheses.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_911">America is the only country where we have been able to witness the natural and tranquil development of a society and where it has been possible to clarify the influence that the point of departure exercised on the future of States.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt442" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt442_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>48<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_912">At the time when European peoples descended upon the shores of the New World, the features of their national character were already well fixed; each of them had a distinct physiognomy. And since they had already reached the level of civilization that leads men to self-study, they have handed down to us a faithful picture of their opinions, mores, and laws. The men of the fifteenth century are almost as well-known to us as those of our own. So America shows us in full light what the ignorance and the barbarism of the first ages concealed from our view.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_913">Close enough to the era of the founding of the American societies to know their elements in detail, far enough from that time to be able already to judge what these seeds produced, men in our time seem destined to see further into human events than their predecessors. Providence has put within our reach a light that our fathers lacked and has allowed us to discern the first causes of the destiny of nations that the obscurity of the past hid from them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_914">When, after attentively studying the history of America, you carefully <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>49<span class="bracket">]</span></span> examine its political and social state, you feel deeply convinced of this truth: there is not an opinion, not a habit, not a law, I could say not an event, that the point of departure does not easily explain. So those who read this book will find in the present chapter the germ of what must follow and the key to nearly the whole book.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt443" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt443_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_915">The emigrants who came at different times to occupy the territory that the American Union covers today differed from each other in many ways; their aim was not the same, and they governed themselves according to various principles.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_916">These men shared common features, however, and they all found themselves in an analogous situation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_917">The bond of language is perhaps the strongest and most durable that can unite men. All the emigrants spoke the same language; they were all children of the same people. They were born in a country troubled, for centuries, by the struggle of parties, and where the factions had been obliged, one by one, to place themselves under the protection of the laws. Their political education was shaped in this rude school, and you saw more notions of rights, more principles of true liberty spread among them than among most of the peoples of Europe. At the time of the first migrations, town government, this fertile seed of free institutions, had already entered <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>50<span class="bracket">]</span></span> deeply into English habits; and with it, the dogma of the sovereignty of the people was introduced even within the Tudor monarchy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_918">People were then in the middle of the religious quarrels that troubled the Christian world. England had thrown itself into this new course with a sort of fury. The character of the inhabitants, which had always been grave and thoughtful, had become austere and argumentative. These intellectual struggles had greatly increased education and had stimulated deeper cultivation of the mind. While people were occupied with talk of religion, mores became more pure. All these general features of the nation were found more or less in the physiognomy of those of its sons who had come to seek a new future on the opposite shores of the ocean.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_919">Moreover, a remark, which we will have the occasion to return to later, is applicable not only to the English but also to the French, to the Spanish, and to all the Europeans who came successively to settle the shores of the New World. All the new European colonies contained, if not the development, at least the germ, of a complete democracy. Two causes led to this result. [Among the emigrants, unlike in the old societies of Europe, neither conquerors nor conquered were seen.] It can be said in general, that, at their departure from the mother country, the emigrants had no idea whatsoever of any kind of superiority of some over others. It is hardly the happy and the powerful who go into exile, and poverty as well as misfortune are the best guarantees of equality that are known among men. It happened, however, that on several occasions great lords went to America following political or religious quarrels. Laws were made in order to establish a hierarchy of ranks there, but it was soon noticed that the American soil absolutely rejected territorial aristocracy. To clear that intractable land nothing less was required than the constant and interested efforts of the proprietor himself. The ground prepared, it was found that production was not great enough to enrich both a master and a tenant at the same time. So the land was naturally divided into small estates that the proprietor cultivated alone.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt444" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt444_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> Now, aristocracy clings to the land; it is attached to the soil and relies upon the soil for support. It is not privileges alone that establish it; it is not birth <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>51<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that constitutes it; it is landed property handed down by inheritance. A nation may exhibit immense fortunes and great misery; but if these fortunes are not territorial, you see poor and rich in its bosom; truly speaking, there is no aristocracy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt445" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt445_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_920">So all the English colonies, at the time of their birth, shared a great family resemblance. All, from their beginning, seemed destined to present the development of liberty, not the aristocratic liberty of their mother country, but the bourgeois and democratic liberty of which the history of the world did not yet offer a complete model.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt446" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt446_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_921">Noticeable in the midst of this general coloration, however, were some very strong nuances that must be pointed out.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_922">In the great Anglo-American family, two principal branches can be distinguished, one in the South, one in the North; until now, they have grown up without being completely merged.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_923">Virginia received the first English colony. The emigrants arrived there in 1607. At this time, Europe was still singularly preoccupied with the idea that mines of gold and silver constituted the wealth of peoples. This destructive idea has done more to impoverish the European nations that embraced it and, in America, has destroyed more men than war and all bad laws put together. So it was gold seekers who were sent to Virginia,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt447" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt447_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> men without resources and without proper behavior, whose restless and turbulent spirit troubled the early years of the colony<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt448" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt448_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> and made its progress <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>52<span class="bracket">]</span></span> uncertain. Afterwards came the manufacturers and farmers, a more moral and quieter breed, but one that in hardly any ways rose above the level of the lower classes of England.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt449" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt449_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> No noble thought, no plans that were not material, directed the foundation of these new establishments. The colony was scarcely established before slavery was introduced there;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt450" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt450_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> that was the capital fact that would exercise an immense influence on the character, the laws and the entire future of the South.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_924">Slavery, as we will explain later, dishonors work; into society, it introduces idleness, along with ignorance and pride, poverty and luxury. It enervates the forces of the mind and puts human activity to sleep. The influence of slavery, combined with the English character, explains the mores and the social state [{the character}] of the South.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt451" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt451_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_925">[≠Even the outward appearance of the settlers assumed the imprint of the habits of their life. The Virginian race is recognizable everywhere by its height and by the air of nobility and command that prevails among its features.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_926">In the North, completely opposite nuances were painted on this same English background. Allow me some details here.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_927">In the English colonies of the North, better known as the New England states,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt452" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt452_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> were combined the two or three principal ideas that today form the foundations of the social theory of the United States.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_929">The founding of New England offered a new spectacle; everything there was singular and original.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_930">[≠You would search the entire history of humanity in vain for an event that presented some analogy to what we are describing.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt453" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt453_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a>≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_931">Nearly all colonies have had as first inhabitants either men without education and without resources, who were pushed out of the country where they had been born by poverty and misconduct, or avid speculators and business agents. There are some colonies that cannot claim even such an origin. Santo Domingo was founded by pirates; and today the English courts of justice are in charge of peopling Australia.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt454" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt454_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_932">The emigrants who came to settle the shores of New England all belonged to the comfortable classes of the mother country. Their gathering on American soil presented, from the beginning, the singular phenomenon of a society in which there were neither great lords,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt455" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt455_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a> nor lower classes, neither poor, nor rich, so to speak. [I have already said that, among the Europeans who went to America, conditions were in general largely equal, but it can be said that, in a way, these emigrants {the Puritans} carried democracy even within democracy.] In proportion, there was a greater amount of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>54<span class="bracket">]</span></span> learning spread among these men than within any European nation of the present day. All, perhaps without a single exception, had received a rather advanced education; and several among them had made themselves known in Europe by their talents and knowledge. The other colonies had been founded by adventurers without families; the emigrants of New England brought with them admirable elements of order and morality; they went to the wilderness accompanied by their wives and children. But what distinguished them, above all, from all the others was the very aim of their enterprise. It was not necessity that forced them to abandon their country; there they left a social position worthy of regret and a secure livelihood. Nor did they come to the New World in order to improve their situation or to increase their wealth; they tore themselves from the comforts of their homeland to obey a purely intellectual need. By exposing themselves to the inevitable hardships of exile, they wanted to assure the triumph of <span class="ital">an idea.</span></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_933">The emigrants, or, as they so accurately called themselves, the <span class="ital">pilgrims,</span> belonged to that English sect given the name Puritan because of the austerity of its principles. Puritanism was not only a religious doctrine, but also at several points it was mingled with the most absolute democratic and republican theories. From that had come its most dangerous adversaries. The Puritans, persecuted by the government of the mother country and, in the strictness of their principles, offended by the daily course of the society in which they lived, sought a land so barbarous and so abandoned by the world that they would still be allowed to live there as they wished and to pray to God in liberty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_934">A few citations will show the spirit of these pious adventurers better than anything that we could add.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_935">Nathaniel Morton, historian of the first years of New England, begins in this way:<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt456" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt456_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a></p>

[Heb. XI, 16 (ed.)] [… (ed.) …] They finally arrived at the port where the vessel awaited them. A great number of friends who could not leave with them had at least wanted to follow them to this port. The night went by without sleep; it passed with outpourings of friendship, with pious speeches, with expressions full of a true Christian tenderness. The next day they went aboard; their friends still wanted to accompany them; then you heard deep sighs, you saw tears running from all eyes, you heard long hugs and kisses and fervent prayers that made strangers themselves feel moved. [… (ed.) …] Once the signal for departure was given, they fell on their knees, and their pastor, raising eyes full of tears toward heaven, commended them to the mercy of the Lord. Finally they took leave of each other, and pronounced this farewell that, for many among them, was to be the last.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_941">The emigrants numbered about one hundred and fifty, men as well as women and children. Their goal was to found a colony on the banks of the Hudson, but, after wandering a long time on the ocean, they were finally forced to land on the arid coasts of New England, at the place where the town of Plymouth is found today. The rock where the pilgrims landed is still displayed.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt460" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt460_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_945">You must not believe that the piety of the Puritans was only speculative, or that it proved to be unfamiliar with the course of human concerns. Puritanism, as I said above, was almost as much a political theory as a religious doctrine. So, scarcely are these emigrants disembarked on this inhospitable coast that Nathaniel Morton has just described than their first concern is to organize themselves as a society. They immediately enact an agreement [&lt;It is the social contract in proper form that Rousseau dreamed of in the following century&gt;] which<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt463" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt463_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">*</a> reads:<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt464" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt464_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">10</a></p>

</div>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_947">This took place in 1620. From that period on, emigration did not stop. Each year, the religious and political passions that tore apart the British Empire throughout the reign of Charles I drove new swarms of sectarians to the coasts of America. In England, the center of Puritanism continued to be located in the middle classes;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt468" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt468_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a> most of the emigrants came from within the middle classes. The population of New England increased rapidly; and, while in the mother country men were still classed despotically according to the hierarchy of ranks, the colony increasingly presented the novel spectacle of a thoroughly homogeneous society. Democracy, such as antiquity had not dared dream it, burst forth fully grown and fully armed from the midst of the old feudal society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_948">Content to remove the seeds of troubles and the elements of new revolutions, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>60<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the English government watched this heavy emigration without distress. It even encouraged it with all of its power and seemed hardly at all concerned with the fate of those who came to American soil seeking a refuge from the harshness of its laws. You could have said that the English government saw New England as a region delivered to the dreams of the imagination that should be abandoned to the free experiments of innovators.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_949">The English colonies, and this was one of the principal causes of their prosperity, always enjoyed more internal liberty and more political independence than the colonies of other peoples; but nowhere was this principle of liberty more completely applied than in the states of New England.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_950">It was then generally agreed that the lands of the New World belonged to the European nation that had first discovered them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_951">In this way, nearly the entire littoral of North America became an English possession toward the end of the sixteenth century. The means used by the British government to populate these new domains were of different kinds. In certain cases, the king subjected a portion of the New World to a governor of his choosing, charged with administering the country in his name and under his direct orders;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt469" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt469_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">11</a> this is the colonial system adopted by the rest of Europe. At other times, he granted ownership of certain portions of the country to a man or to a company.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt470" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt470_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">12</a> All the civil and political powers were then concentrated in the hands of one or several individuals who, under the inspection and control of the crown, sold the land and governed the inhabitants. Finally, a third system consisted of giving a certain number of emigrants the right to form a political society, under the patronage of the mother country, and to govern themselves in everything not contrary to its laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_952">This method of colonization, so favorable to liberty, was put into practice only in New England.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt471" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt471_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">13</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>61<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_953">As early as 1628,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt472" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt472_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">14</a> a charter of this nature was granted by Charles I to the emigrants who came to found the colony of Massachusetts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_954">But, in general, charters were not granted to the colonies of New England until long after their existence had become an accomplished fact. Plymouth, Providence, New Haven, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt473" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt473_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">15</a> were founded without the support and, in a sense, without the knowledge of the mother country. The new inhabitants, without denying the supremacy of the home country, did not draw on it as the source of powers; they incorporated themselves. And it was only thirty or forty years after, under Charles II, that a royal charter legalized their existence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_955">So it is often difficult, while surveying the first historical and legislative memorials of New England, to see the link connecting the emigrants to the country of their ancestors. At every moment you can see them performing some act of sovereignty; they name their magistrates, make peace and war, establish regulations for public order, provide laws for themselves as if they were answerable only to God alone<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt474" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt474_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">16</a> [≠later, when the colonies began to become powerful, the mother country raised the claim of defending and directing them≠].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_956">Nothing is more singular and, at the very same time, more instructive <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>62<span class="bracket">]</span></span> than the legislation of this period;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt475" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt475_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a> there, above all, is found the key to the great social enigma that the United States presents to the world of today.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_957">Among these memorials, we will particularly single out, as one of the most characteristic, the law code that the small state of Connecticut gave itself in 1650.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt476" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt476_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">17</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_958">The legislators of Connecticut<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt477" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt477_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">18</a> first take charge of the penal laws; and to write them, they conceive the strange idea of drawing upon sacred texts:</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_959">“Whoever will worship a God other than the Lord,” they begin by saying, “will be put to death.”</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_960">Ten or twelve clauses of the same nature, borrowed word for word from <span class="ital">Deuteronomy, Exodus</span> and <span class="ital">Leviticus,</span> follow.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_961">Blasphemy, witchcraft, adultery,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt478" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt478_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">19</a> rape are punished with death; the same punishment is imposed on flagrant insult by a son toward his parents. In this way, the legislation of a primitive and half-civilized people was transferred to a society in which minds were enlightened and mores were mild; so the death penalty was never so common in the laws, nor so rarely applied to the guilty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_962">Above all, in this body of penal laws, the legislators are preoccupied with upholding moral order and standards of good behavior; they constantly enter, therefore, into the realm of conscience. There is hardly any sin that <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>63<span class="bracket">]</span></span> they do not manage to submit to the censure of the magistrate. The reader has been able to observe how harshly the laws punished adultery and rape. Mere flirtation between unmarried people is severely suppressed. On the guilty, the judge has the right to inflict one of three punishments: a fine, a flogging or a wedding.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt479" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt479_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">20</a> And if the records of the old courts of New Haven are to be believed, proceedings of this nature were not rare; you find, dated May 1, 1660, a verdict with a fine and reprimand against a young woman accused of having uttered a few indiscreet words and of allowing herself to be kissed.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt480" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt480_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">21</a> The Code of 1650 abounds in preventive measures. Laziness and drunkenness are severely punished.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt481" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt481_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">22</a> Innkeepers cannot provide more than a certain quantity of wine to each consumer; a fine or a flogging cracks down on a simple lie when it might be harmful.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt482" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt482_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">23</a> In other places, the legislator, completely forgetting the great principles of religious liberty that he claimed in Europe, forces, by threat of fines, attendance at divine<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt483" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt483_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">24</a> worship.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt484" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt484_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a> And he goes so far as to impose severe penalties,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt485" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt485_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">25</a> and often death, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>64<span class="bracket">]</span></span> on Christians who want to worship God according to a creed different from his own.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt486" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt486_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">26</a> Finally, the fervor for regulations, which possesses him, sometimes leads him to deal with concerns most unworthy of him. Thus, in the same code, there is a law that prohibits the use of tobacco.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt487" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt487_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">27</a> It must not be forgotten, moreover, that these bizarre or tyrannical laws were not at all imposed; that they were voted by the free participation of all those concerned; and that the mores were still more austere and puritanical than the laws. In the year 1649, a solemn association was formed in Boston whose purpose was to prevent the worldly luxury of long hair.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt488" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt488_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">28</a> <a href="#n005" id="n005_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">E</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_963">Such errors undoubtedly shame the human spirit; they testify to the infirmity of our nature, which, incapable of firmly grasping the true and the just, is most often reduced to choosing only between two excesses.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_964">Alongside this penal legislation, so strongly stamped by narrow sectarian spirit and by all the religious passions that were excited by persecution and were still seething deep within souls, a body of political laws is found. The two are, in a way, bound together. But those political laws, written two hundred years ago, still seem very far ahead of the spirit of liberty of our age.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_965">The general principles on which modern constitutions rest, which most of the Europeans of the seventeenth century scarcely understood and which at that time triumphed incompletely in Great Britain, were all recognized and laid down by the laws of New England. There, the intervention of the people in public affairs, the free vote of taxes, the responsibility <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>65<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of the agents of power, individual liberty, and jury trial were established without argument and in fact.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_966">There, these generative principles receive an application and developments that not a single European nation has yet dared to give them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_967">In Connecticut, from the beginning, the electoral body was comprised of all citizens, and that is understood without difficulty.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt489" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt489_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">29</a> Among this emerging people, a nearly perfect equality of means and, even more, of minds then reigned.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt490" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt490_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">30</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_969">[In Connecticut in 1650, all] The citizens older than sixteen years of age were obliged to bear arms; they formed a national militia that named its officers and had to be ready at all times to march in defense of the country.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt492" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt492_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">32</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_970">In the laws of Connecticut, as in all those of New England, you see arising and developing the town independence that still today constitutes the principle and life of American liberty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_971">Among most European nations, political existence began in the higher ranks of society; little by little and always incompletely, it was transmitted to the various parts of the social body.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_972">In America, in contrast, you can say that the town was organized before the county; the county, before the state; the state, before the Union.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_973">In New England, as early as 1650, the town is completely and definitively formed.

Within the town, a real, active, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>66<span class="bracket">]</span></span> totally democratic and republican political life reigns.

[{Nothing then in our old Europe could give the idea of a social organization as extensive and as perfect.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_979">But it is in the prescriptions relating to public education that, from the very beginning, you see fully revealed the original character of American civilization.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_980">“Whereas, says the law, Satan, enemy of humanity, finds in the ignorance of men his most powerful weapons, and it is important that the knowledge brought by our fathers does not remain buried in their grave;—where as the education of children is one of the first interests of the State, with the help of the Lord …”<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt499" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt499_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">39</a> Then follow the provisions that create schools in all the towns and oblige the inhabitants, under penalty of heavy fines, to tax themselves to support them.

And if resistance continues, society then displaces the family, lays hold of the child and removes from the fathers the rights that nature had given to them, but that they knew so poorly how to use.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt501" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt501_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">40</a> The reader will undoubtedly have noticed the preamble of these ordinances: in America, it is religion that leads to enlightenment; it is the observance of divine laws that brings men to liberty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_981">When, after thus casting a rapid glance over American society in 1650, you examine the state of Europe and particularly that of the continent <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>68<span class="bracket">]</span></span> around this same era, you are filled by a profound astonishment. On the European continent, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, absolute monarchy triumphed on all sides over the ruins of the oligarchic and feudal liberty of the Middle Ages. [&lt;≠The top of the social edifice already received the lights of modern civilization, while the base still remained in the darkness of ignorance [v. of the Middle Ages].≠&gt;] In the heart of this brilliant and literary Europe, the idea of rights had perhaps never been more completely misunderstood; never had peoples experienced less of political life; never had minds been less preoccupied by the notions of true liberty. And at that time these same principles, unknown or scorned by European nations, were proclaimed in the wilderness of the New World and became the future creed [{political catechism}] of a great people. The boldest theories of the human mind were reduced to practice in this society so humble in appearance, a society in which probably not a single statesman would then have deigned to be involved; there, the imagination of man, abandoned to its natural originality, improvised legislation without precedent. Within this obscure democracy that had still not brought forth either generals, or philosophers, or great writers, a man could stand up in the presence of a free people and give, to the acclamation of all, this beautiful definition of liberty:<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt502" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt502_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">41</a></p>

This liberty is the enemy of all authority; it suffers all rules with impatience; with it, we become inferior to ourselves; it is the enemy of truth and peace; and God believed that he had to rise up against it! But there is a civil and moral liberty that finds its strength in union, and that the mission of power itself is to protect; it is the liberty to do without fear all that is just and good. This holy liberty we must defend at all cost, and if necessary, at risk of our life.</p>
</div>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_983">I have already said enough to reveal Anglo-American civilization in its true light. It is the product (and this point of departure must always be kept in mind) of two perfectly distinct elements that elsewhere are often at odds. But in America, these two have been successfully blended, in a way, and marvelously combined. I mean the <span class="ital">spirit of religion</span> and the <span class="ital">spirit of liberty.</span></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_984">The founders of New England were at the very same time ardent sectarians and impassioned innovators. Restrained by the tightest bonds of certain religious beliefs, they were free of all political prejudices. [{Religion led them to enlightenment; the observance of divine laws brought them to liberty.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_985">From that, two diverse but not opposite tendencies resulted whose traces can easily be found everywhere, in the mores as in the laws.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt504" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt504_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_986">Some men sacrifice their friends, family, and native land for a religious opinion; you could believe that they are absorbed in the pursuit of the intellectual good that they have come to purchase at such a high price. You see them, however, seeking material riches and moral enjoyments with an almost equal fervor, heaven in the other world, and well-being and liberty in this one.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_987">In their hands, political principles, laws, and human institutions seem to be malleable things that can be shaped and combined at will.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_988">The barriers that imprisoned the society where they were born fall before <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>70<span class="bracket">]</span></span> them; old opinions that for centuries ruled the world vanish; an almost limitless course and a field without horizons open. The human mind rushes toward them, sweeping over them in all directions. But having arrived at the limits of the political world, it stops by itself. In fear and trembling, it sets aside the use of its most formidable abilities, abjures doubt, renounces the need to innovate, refrains even from lifting the veil of the sanctuary, and bows respectfully before truths that it accepts without discussion. [≠After having rested awhile in the midst of the certainties of the moral order, man begins to move again and reenters the political arena with more fervor.≠]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt505" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt505_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_989">In the moral world, therefore, everything is classified, coordinated, foreseen, decided in advance. In the political world, everything is agitated, contested, uncertain; in the one, passive though voluntary obedience; in the other, independence, scorn for experience and jealousy of all authority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_990">Far from harming each other, these two tendencies, apparently so opposed, move in harmony and seem to offer mutual support.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_991">Religion sees in civil liberty a noble exercise of the faculties of man; in the political world, a field offered by the Creator to the efforts of intelligence. Free and powerful in its sphere, satisfied with the place reserved for it, religion knows that its dominion is that much better established because it rules only by its own strength and dominates hearts without other support.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_992">Liberty sees in religion the companion of its struggles and triumphs, the cradle of its early years, the divine source of its rights. Liberty considers religion as the safeguard of mores, mores as the guarantee of laws and the pledge of its own duration.<a href="#n006" id="n006_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">F</a></p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_995">[≠From whatever side I envisage the laws and mores of the Anglo-Americans, I rediscover striking traces of their origin {of the point of departure}.

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_996">The reader must not draw from what precedes consequences that are too general and absolute. The social condition, the religion and the mores of the first emigrants undoubtedly exercised an immense influence over the destiny of their new country. It was not up to them, however, to establish a society whose point of departure was found only within themselves; no one can entirely free himself from the past. With ideas and customs that were their own, they mingled, either voluntarily or unknowingly, other customs and ideas that they got from their education or from the national traditions of their country.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_997">So when you want to know and judge the Anglo-Americans of today, what is of Puritan origin or of English origin must be carefully distinguished.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_998">You often encounter in the United States laws and customs that contrast with all that surrounds them. These laws seem written in a spirit opposed to the dominant spirit of American legislation; these mores seem contrary to the social state as a whole. If the English colonies had been founded in a century of darkness, or if their origin was already lost in the shadows of time, the problem would be insoluble.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>72<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_999">I will cite a single example to make my thought understood.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1000">The civil and criminal legislation of the Americans knows only two means of action: <span class="ital">prison</span> or <span class="ital">bail.</span><a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt507" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt507_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> The first action in proceedings consists of obtaining bail from the defendant or, if he refuses, of having him incarcerated; afterwards the validity of the evidence or the gravity of the charges is discussed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1001">Clearly such legislation is directed against the poor and favors only the rich.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1002">A poor man does not always make bail, even in civil matters, and if he is forced to await justice in prison, his forced inactivity soon reduces him to destitution.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt508" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt508_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1003">A wealthy man, on the contrary, always succeeds in escaping imprisonment in civil matters; even more, if he has committed a crime, he easily evades the punishment awaiting him: after providing bail, he disappears. So it can be said that for him all the penalties of the law are reduced to fines.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt509" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt509_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">42</a> What is more aristocratic than such legislation?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt510" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt510_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1004">In America, however, it is the poor who make the law, and usually they reserve the greatest advantages of society for themselves.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1005">It is in England where the explanation for this phenomenon must be found: the laws I am speaking about are English.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt511" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt511_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">43</a> The Americans have not changed them, even though they are repugnant to their legislation as a whole and to the mass of their ideas.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1006">The thing that people change the least after their customs is their civil <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>73<span class="bracket">]</span></span> legislation. The civil laws are familiar only to jurists, that is, to those who have a direct interest in keeping them as they are, good or bad, because they know them. The bulk of the nation knows them hardly at all; they see them in action only in individual cases, grasp their tendency only with difficulty, and submit to them without thinking about it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1007">I have cited an example; I could have pointed out many others.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1008">The picture that American society presents is, if I can express myself in this way, covered by a democratic layer beneath which from time to time you catch a glimpse of the old colors of the aristocracy.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1016">The social state of the Americans is eminently democratic. It has had this character since the birth of the colonies; it has it even more today.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt516" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt516_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1020">I said in the preceding chapter that a very great equality reigned among the emigrants who came to settle on the shores of New England. Not even the germ of aristocracy was ever deposited in that part of the Union. No influences except intellectual ones [{a kind of intellectual patronage}]could ever be established there. The people got used to revering certain names, as symbols of learning and virtue. The voice of certain citizens gained a power over the people that perhaps could have been correctly called aristocratic, if it could have been passed down invariably from father to son.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1021">This happened [{north}] east of the Hudson; [{south}] southwest of this river, and as far down as Florida, things were otherwise.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>77<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1022">In most of the States situated southwest<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt519" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt519_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a> of the Hudson, great English landholders had come to settle. Aristocratic principles, and with them English laws of inheritance, had been imported.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt520" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt520_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> I have shown the reasons that prevented a powerful aristocracy from ever being established in America. But these reasons, though existing southwest<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt521" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt521_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a> of the Hudson, had less power there than [{north}] east of this river. To the south, one man alone could, with the help of slaves, cultivate a large expanse of land. So in this part of the continent wealthy landed proprietors were seen; but their influence was not precisely aristocratic, as understood in Europe, because they had no privileges at all, and cultivation by slaves gave them no tenants and therefore no patronage. Nonetheless, south of the Hudson, the great landholders formed a superior class, with its own ideas and tastes and generally concentrating political activity within its ranks. It was a kind of aristocracy not much different from the mass of the people whose passions and interests it easily embraced, exciting neither love nor hate;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt522" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt522_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> in sum, weak and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>78<span class="bracket">]</span></span> not very hardy. It was this class that, in the South, put itself at the head of the insurrection; the American Revolution owed its greatest men to it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1023">In this period, the entire society was shaken.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt523" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt523_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a> The people, in whose name the struggle was waged, the people—now a power—conceived the desire to act by themselves; democratic instincts awoke.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt524" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt524_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a> By breaking the yoke of the home country, the people acquired a taste for all kinds of independence. Little by little, individual influences ceased to make themselves felt; habits as well as laws began to march in unison toward the same end.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1024">But it was the law of inheritance that pushed equality to its last stage.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt525" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt525_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>79<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1025">I am astonished that ancient and modern political writers have not attributed a greater influence on the course of human affairs to the laws of landed inheritance.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt526" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt526_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> These laws belong, it is true, to the civil order; but they should be placed at the head of all political institutions, for they have an incredible influence on the social state of peoples, political laws being just the expression of the social state. In addition, the laws of inheritance have a sure and uniform way of operating on society; in a sense they lay hold of generations before their birth. Through them, man is armed with an almost divine power over the future of his fellows. The law-maker regulates the inheritance of citizens once, and he remains at rest for centuries: his work put in motion, he can keep his hands off; the machine acts on its own power, and moves as if self-directed toward an end set in advance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1026">Constituted in a certain way, the law of inheritance reunites, concentrates, gathers property and, soon after, power, around some head; in a way it makes aristocracy spring from the soil. Driven by other principles and set along another path, its action is even more rapid; it divides, shares, disseminates <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>80<span class="bracket">]</span></span> property and power. Sometimes people are then frightened by the rapidity of its march. Despairing of stopping its movement, they seek at least to create difficulties and obstacles before it; they want to counterbalance its action with opposing efforts; useless exertions! It crushes or sends flying into pieces all that gets in its way; it constantly rises and falls on the earth until nothing is left in sight but a shifting and intangible dust<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt527" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt527_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a> on which democracy takes its seat.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1027">When the law of inheritance allows and, even more, requires the equal division of the father’s property among all the children, its effects are of two sorts; they should be carefully distinguished, even though they lead to the same end.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1028">Due to the law of inheritance, the death of each owner leads to a revolution in property; not only do the holdings change masters, but so to speak, they change nature; they are constantly split into smaller portions. [The generations grow poorer as they succeed each other.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1029">That is the direct and, in a sense, the material effect of the law.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt528" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt528_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a> So in countries where legislation establishes equal division, property and particularly territorial fortunes necessarily have a permanent tendency to grow smaller. Nonetheless, if the law were left to itself, the effects of this legislation would make themselves felt only over time. Because as long as the family includes not more than two children (and the average for families in a populated country like France, we are told, is only three),<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt529" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt529_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a> these children, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>81<span class="bracket">]</span></span> sharing the wealth of their father and their mother, will be no less wealthy than each parent individually.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1030">But the law of equal division exerts its influence not on the fate of property alone; it acts on the very soul of the proprietors, and calls their passions to its aid. These indirect effects rapidly destroy great fortunes and, above all, great estates.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt530" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt530_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1031">Among peoples for whom the inheritance law is based on the right of primogeniture, landed estates most often pass from generation to generation without being divided. That causes family spirit to be, in a way, embodied in the land. The family represents the land; the land represents the family; the land perpetuates its name, origin, glory, power and virtues. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>82<span class="bracket">]</span></span> It is an undying witness to the past and a precious guarantee of life to come.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt531" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt531_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1032">When the inheritance law establishes equal division, it destroys the intimate connection that existed between family spirit and keeping the land; the land ceases to represent the family, for the land, inescapably divided after one or two generations, clearly must shrink continually and disappear entirely in the end. The sons of a great landed proprietor, if they are few, or if fortune favors them, can maintain the hope of not being poorer than their progenitor, but not of owning the same lands as he; their wealth will necessarily consist of other elements than his.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt532" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt532_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1033">Now, from the moment you take away from landed proprietors any great interest—arising from sentiment, memory, pride, or ambition—in keeping the land, you can be sure that sooner or later they will sell it. They have a great pecuniary interest in selling, since movable assets produce more income than other assets and lend themselves much more easily to satisfying the passions of the moment.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt533" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt533_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1034">Once divided, great landed estates are never reassembled; for the small landholder gains proportionately more revenue from his field<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt534" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt534_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> than the large landholder; so he sells it at a much higher price than the large landholder. Thus the economic calculations that brought a rich man to sell vast properties, will prevent him, with all the more reason, from buying small properties in order to reassemble large estates.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt535" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt535_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1035">What is called family spirit is often based on an illusion of individual <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>83<span class="bracket">]</span></span> egoism.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt536" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt536_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a> A person seeks to perpetuate and, in a way, to immortalize himself in his great-nephews.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt537" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt537_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a> Where family spirit ends, individual egoism reverts to its true inclinations. Since the family no longer enters the mind except as something vague, indeterminate, and uncertain, each man concentrates on present convenience; he considers the establishment of the generation immediately following, and nothing more.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1036">So a person does not try to perpetuate his family, or at least he tries to perpetuate it by means other than landed property.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1037">Thus, not only does the inheritance law make it difficult for families to keep the same estates intact, but also it removes the desire to try and leads families, in a way, to cooperate in their own ruin.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1038">The law of equal division proceeds in two ways: by acting on the thing, it acts on the man; by acting on the man, it affects the thing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1039">In these two ways it succeeds in profoundly attacking landed property and in making families as well as fortunes rapidly disappear.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt538" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt538_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1040">Surely it is not up to us, the French of the nineteenth century, daily witnesses to the political and social changes that the inheritance law brings about, to question its power. Each day we see it constantly move back and forth over our soil, toppling in its path the walls of our dwellings and destroying <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>84<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the hedges of our fields. But if the inheritance law has already accomplished much among us, much still remains for it to do. Our memories, opinions, and habits present it with powerful obstacles.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt539" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt539_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1041">In the United States, its work of destruction is nearly finished. That is where its principal results can be studied.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1042">English legislation on the transmission of property was abolished in nearly all the states at the time of the Revolution.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1043">The law of entail was modified so as to interfere only imperceptibly with the free circulation of property.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt540" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt540_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a> <a href="#n007" id="n007_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">G</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1044">The first generation disappeared; landed estates began to divide. As time went by, the movement became more and more rapid [as a stone thrown from the top of a tower accelerates as it moves through space]. Today, when hardly sixty years have gone by, the appearance of society is already unrecognizable; the families of the great landed proprietors are almost entirely engulfed by the common mass. In the state of New York, which had a very large number of such families, two barely stay afloat above the abyss ready to swallow them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt541" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt541_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> Today, the sons of these opulent citizens are businessmen, lawyers, doctors. Most have fallen into the most profound obscurity. The last trace of hereditary rank and distinction is destroyed; the law of inheritance has done its leveling everywhere.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt542" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt542_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1045">It is not that there are no rich in the United States as there are elsewhere; I do not even know of a country where the love of money holds a greater place in the human heart and where a deeper contempt is professed for the theory of the permanent equality of property.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt543" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt543_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> But wealth circulates there with incredible rapidity, and experience teaches that it is rare to see two generations reap the rewards of wealth.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt544" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt544_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> [{The people are like the divinity of this new world; everything emanates from and returns to them.}]</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1046">This picture, however colored you think it is, still gives only an incomplete idea of what is happening in the new states of the West and Southwest.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt545" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt545_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1047">At the end of the last century, hardy adventurers began to penetrate the valleys of the Mississippi. This was like a new discovery of America: soon the bulk of emigration went there; you saw unknown societies suddenly emerge from the wilderness. States, whose names did not even exist a few years before, took a place within the American Union. [&lt;≠Hardly a year passed without the republic being forced to have some new star attached to its flag.≠&gt;] In the West democracy can be observed carried to its extreme limit. In these states, in a way improvised by chance, the inhabitants arrived but yesterday on the soil they occupy. They scarcely know each other, and each one is unaware of the history of his closest neighbor. So in this part of the American continent, the population escapes not only from the influence of great names and great wealth, but also from the natural aristocracy that arises from enlightenment and virtue. There, no one exercises the power that men grant out of respect for an entire life spent in doing good before their eyes. The new states of the West already have inhabitants; society still does not exist.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1048">But not only fortunes are equal in America; to a certain degree, equality extends to minds themselves.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1049">I do not think there is any country in the world where, in proportion to the population, there exist so small a number of ignorant and fewer learned men than in America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1050">There primary education is available to every one; higher education is hardly available to anyone.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1051">This is easily understood and is, so to speak, the necessary result of what we advanced above.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1052">Nearly all Americans live comfortably; so they can easily gain the primary elements of human knowledge.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1053">In America, there are few rich [≠and the rich do not form a class apart. The consequences of this fact in relation to education are of several kinds.≠]; nearly all Americans need to have an occupation. Now, every occupation requires an apprenticeship. So Americans can devote only the first years of life to general cultivation of the mind; at age fifteen, they begin a career; most often, therefore, their education concludes when ours begins. If pursued further, it is directed only toward a specialized and lucrative field; they study a field of knowledge in the way they prepare for a trade; and they take only the applications recognized to have immediate utility.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1054">In America, most of the rich began by being poor; nearly all the men of leisure were busy men in their youth. The result is that when they could have the taste for study, they do not have the time to devote themselves to it; and when they have gained the time, they no longer have the taste.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1055">So in America no class exists that honors intellectual work and in which the penchant for intellectual pleasures is handed down with affluence and hereditary leisure.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1056">Both the will and the power to devote oneself to this work are therefore missing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1057">In America a certain middling level of human knowledge is established. All minds have approached it; some by rising, others by falling.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>88<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1058">So you meet a great multitude of individuals who have about the same number of notions in matters of religion, history, the sciences, political economy, legislation, and government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1059">Intellectual inequality comes directly from God, and man cannot prevent it from always reappearing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1060">But it follows, at least from what we have just said, that minds, while still remaining unequal as the Creator intended, find equal means at their disposal. Thus, today in America, the aristocratic element, always feeble since its birth, is, if not destroyed, at least weakened further; so it is difficult to assign it any influence whatsoever in the course of public affairs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1061">Time, events, and the laws have, on the contrary, made the democratic element not only preponderant but also, so to speak, unique. No family or group influence can be seen; often not even an individual influence, no matter how ephemeral, can be found.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1062">[{Society there [is (ed.)] profoundly and radically democratic in its religion, ideas, habits, and passions.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt546" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt546_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a>}</p>

<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_039">Political Consequences of the Social State of the Anglo-Americans</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1066">The political consequences of such a social state are easy to deduce.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1067">It is impossible to think that, in the end, equality would not penetrate the political world as it does elsewhere. You cannot imagine men, equal in all other ways, forever unequal to each other on a single point; so in time they will become equal in all ways.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1068">Now I know only two ways to have equality rule in the political world: rights must either be given to each citizen or given to no one [and apart from the government of the United States I see nothing more democratic than the empire of the great lord].<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt547" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt547_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">TN 2</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1069">For peoples who have arrived at the same social state as the Anglo-Americans, it is therefore very difficult to see a middle course between the sovereignty of all [v: of the people] and the absolute power of one man [v: of a king].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1070">[≠So peoples who have a similar social state are faced with a frightening alternative; they must choose between the sovereignty of the people and the absolute power of a king≠].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1071">We must not hide from the fact that the social state I have just described lends itself almost as easily to the one as to the other of these two consequences.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1072">There is in fact a manly and legitimate passion for equality that incites men to want to be strong and esteemed. This passion tends to elevate the small to the rank of the great. But in the human heart a depraved taste for equality is also found that leads the weak to want to bring the strong down to their level and that reduces men to preferring equality in servitude to inequality in liberty. Not that peoples whose social state is democratic naturally scorn liberty; on the contrary, they have an instinctive taste for it. But liberty is not the principal and constant object of their desire; what they love with undying love is equality; they rush toward liberty by rapid impulses and sudden efforts, and if they miss the goal, they resign themselves; <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>90<span class="bracket">]</span></span> but without equality nothing can satisfy them, and rather than lose it, they would agree to perish.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt548" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt548_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1073">On the other hand, when citizens are all more or less equal, it becomes difficult for them to defend their independence against the aggressions of power. Since none among them is then strong enough to struggle alone with any advantage, it is only the combination of the strength of all that can guarantee liberty. Now, such a combination is not always found.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt549" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt549_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1074">Peoples can therefore draw two great political consequences from the same social state; these consequences differ prodigiously, but they both arise from the same fact.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1075">The first to be subjected to this fearful alternative that I have just described, the Anglo-Americans have been fortunate enough to escape absolute power. Circumstances, origin, enlightenment, and above all, mores have allowed them to establish<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt550" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt550_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> and to maintain the sovereignty of the people.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt551" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt551_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a></p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1077">When you want to talk about the political laws of the United States, you must always begin with the dogma of the sovereignty of the people.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt552" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt552_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1078">The principle of the sovereignty of the people, which is more or less always found at the base of nearly all human institutions, ordinarily remains there as if buried. It is obeyed without being recognized, or if sometimes it happens, for a moment, to be brought into the full light of day, people soon rush to push it back into the shadows of the sanctuary.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1079">The national will is one of those terms abused most widely by schemers of all times and despots of all ages. Some have seen it expressed in votes bought from the brokers of power; others in the votes of an interested or fearful minority. There are even some who have discovered it fully formulated in the silence of the people and who have thought that from the <span class="ital">fact</span> of obedience came, for them, the <span class="ital">right</span> of command.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt553" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt553_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1080">In America, the principle of the sovereignty of the people is not hidden or sterile as it is in certain nations [a vain show and a false principle as among <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>92<span class="bracket">]</span></span> certain others; it is a legal and omnipotent fact that rules the entire society; that spreads freely and reaches its fullest consequences without obstacles]; it is recognized by the mores, proclaimed by the laws; it spreads freely and reaches its fullest consequences without obstacles.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1081">If there is a single country in the world where the true value of the dogma of the sovereignty of the people can hope to be appreciated, where its application to the affairs of society can be studied and where its advantages and dangers can be judged, that country is assuredly America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1082">I said before that, from the beginning, the principle of the sovereignty of the people had been the generative principle of most of the English colonies of America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1083">It then fell far short, however, of dominating the government of society as it does today.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1084">Two obstacles, one external, one internal, slowed its invasive march.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1085">It could not appear openly in the laws because the colonies were still forced to obey the home country; so it was reduced to hiding in the provincial assemblies and especially in the town. There it spread in secret.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1086">American society at that time was not yet ready to adopt it in all its consequences. For a long time, learning in New England and wealth south of the Hudson, exercised, as I showed in the preceding chapter, a sort of aristocratic influence that tended to confine the exercise of social powers to a few hands. It still fell far short of electing all public officials and of making all citizens, voters. Everywhere the right to vote was restricted to certain limits and subordinated to the existence of a property qualification which was very low in the North and more considerable in the South.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt554" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt554_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1087">The American Revolution broke out.

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1088">A change almost as rapid was carried out within the interior of society. The law of inheritance completed the dismantling of local influences.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1089">At the moment when this effect of the laws and of the revolution began to be evident to all, victory had already been irrevocably declared in favor of democracy. Power was in fact in its hands. Even struggling against it was no longer permitted. So the upper classes submitted without a murmur and without a fight to an evil henceforth inevitable. What usually happens to powers that are in decline happened to them: individual egoism took hold of the members of the upper classes.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt557" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt557_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> Since force could no longer be wrested from the hands of the people and since they did not detest the multitude enough to take pleasure in defying it, they came to think only of winning <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>95<span class="bracket">]</span></span> its good will at any cost. [≠Moreover, men have at their disposal such a deep reservoir of baseness, that it is always found more or less the same in the service of all despots, whether people or king.≠] In an effort to outdo each other, the most democratic laws were then voted by the men whose interests were most damaged by them. In this way, the upper classes did not incite [{implacable}] popular passions against themselves; but they themselves hastened the triumph of the new order. So, a strange thing! The democratic impulse showed itself that much more irresistible in the states where aristocracy had more roots.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1090">The state of Maryland, which had been founded by great lords, was the first to proclaim universal suffrage<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt558" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt558_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and introduced the most democratic forms into its whole government.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt559" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt559_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1091">When a people begins to tamper with the electoral qualification, you can foresee that, after a more or less long delay, it will make that qualification disappear completely. That is one of the most invariable rules that govern societies. As the limit of electoral rights is pushed back, the need grows to push it further; for, after each new concession, the forces of democracy increase and its demands grow with its new power. [It is the history of the Romans buying peace with gold.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt560" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt560_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a>] The ambition of those left below the electoral qualification is aroused in proportion to the great number of those who are found above. Finally, the exception becomes the rule; concessions <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>96<span class="bracket">]</span></span> follow one after the other without letup, and there is no more stopping until universal suffrage is reached.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt561" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt561_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1092">Today in the United States the principle of the sovereignty of the people has attained all the practical developments that imagination can conceive. It has been freed from all the fictions that have been carefully placed around it elsewhere; it is seen successively clothed in all forms according to the necessity of the case. Sometimes the people as a body make the laws as at Athens; sometimes the deputies created by universal suffrage represent the people and act in their name under their almost immediate supervision.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1093">There are countries where a power, in a way external to the social body, acts on it and forces it to follow a certain path.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1094">There are others where force is divided, being simultaneously inside and outside the society. Nothing of the sort is seen in the United States; there society acts by itself and on itself.

It can be said that they govern themselves, so weak and restricted is the part left to the administration, so much does the administration feel its popular origin and obey the power from which it emanates.

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1095">The following chapter is intended to examine what form government founded on the principle of sovereignty of the people takes in America, what its means of action, difficulties, advantages and dangers are.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt565" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt565_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1096">A first difficulty arises: the United States has a complex constitution. You notice two distinct societies there, bound together and, if I can explain it in this way, nested like boxes one inside the other. Two completely separate and nearly independent governments are seen: the one, habitual and undefined, which answers to the daily needs of the society; the other, exceptional and circumscribed, which applies only to certain general interests. They are, in a word, twenty-four small sovereign nations, that together form the great body of the Union.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1097">To examine the Union before studying the state is to embark on a path strewn with difficulties. The form of the federal government in the United States appeared last; it was only a modification of the republic, a summary of political principles spread throughout the entire society before the federal government existed, and subsisting there independently of it. As I have just said, the federal government is, moreover, only an exception; the government of the states is the common rule. The writer who would like to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>99<span class="bracket">]</span></span> show such a picture as a whole before pointing out its details would necessarily lapse into obscurities and repetitions.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1098">There can be no doubt that the great political principles that govern American society today arose and developed in the <span class="ital">state.</span> So to have the key to all the rest, the state must be understood.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1099">The states that make up the American Union today all look the same with regard to the external appearance of institutions. Political and administrative life there is found concentrated in three centers of action that could be compared to the various nerve centers that make the human body move.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1100">At the first level is found the <span class="ital">town</span>;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt566" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt566_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">TN 3</a> higher, the <span class="ital">county;</span> finally, the <span class="ital">state.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1102">Not by chance do I first examine the town.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1103">[≠The town is the first element of the societies out of which peoples take form; it is the social molecule; if I can express myself in this way, it is the embryo that already represents and contains the seed of the complete being.≠]</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>101<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1104">The town is the only association that is so much a part of nature that wherever men are gathered together, a town takes shape by itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1105">Town society exists therefore among all peoples no matter what their customs and their laws; it is man who establishes kingdoms and creates republics; the town seems to come directly from the hands of God. [≠The town is not only the first of social elements, but also the most important of all.≠] But if the town has existed ever since there have been men, town liberty is something rare and fragile.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt568" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt568_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> A people can always establish great political assemblies, because it usually contains a certain number of men among whom, to a certain degree, enlightenment takes the place of the practice of public affairs. The town is made up of crude elements that often resist the action of the legislator. Instead of diminishing as nations become more enlightened, the difficulty of establishing town independence increases with their enlightenment. A highly civilized society tolerates the trial efforts of town liberty only with difficulty; it rebels at the sight of its numerous errors and despairs of success before having reached the final result of the experiment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1106">Of all liberties, town liberty, which is so difficult to establish, is also the most exposed to the encroachments of power. Left to themselves, town institutions could scarcely resist a strong and enterprising government; to defend themselves successfully, they must have reached their <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>102<span class="bracket">]</span></span> fullest development and be mingled with national ideas and habits. Thus, as long as town liberty has not become part of the mores, it is easy to destroy; and it can become part of the mores only after existing in the laws for a long time.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1107">Town liberty therefore escapes human effort so to speak. Consequently it is rarely created;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt569" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt569_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> in a sense it arises by itself. It develops almost in secret<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt570" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt570_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> within a semi-barbaric society. The continuous action of laws and of mores, circumstances, and above all time succeed in its consolidation. You can say that, of all the nations of the European continent, not a single one knows town liberty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1108">The strength of free peoples resides in the town, however. Town institutions are to liberty what primary schools are to knowledge; they put it within the grasp of the people; they give them a taste of its peaceful practice and accustom them to its use. Without town institutions, a nation can pretend to have a free government, but it does not possess the spirit of liberty.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt571" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt571_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a> Temporary passions, momentary interests, the chance of circumstances can give it the external forms of independence; but despotism, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>103<span class="bracket">]</span></span> driven back into the interior of the social body, reappears sooner or later at the surface.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1109">To make the reader understand well the general principles on which the political organization of the town and the county in the United States rests, I thought that it was useful to take one state in particular as a model, to examine in detail what happens there, and then to cast a quick glance over the rest of the country.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1110">I have chosen one of the states of New England.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1111">The town and the county are not organized in the same way in all the parts of the Union; it is easy to recognize, however, that throughout the Union the same principles, more or less, have presided over the formation of both.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1112">[≠The town institutions of New England were the first to reach a state of maturity. They present a complete and uniform whole. They serve as a model for the other parts of the Union and tend more and more to become the standard to which all the rest must sooner or later conform.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1113">Now, it seemed to me that in New England these principles were considerably more developed and had attained further consequences than anywhere else. So they are, so to speak, more evident there and are thus more accessible to the observation of the foreigner.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1114">The town institutions of New England form a complete and regular whole. They are old; they are strong because of the laws, stronger still because of the mores; they exercise a prodigious influence over the entire society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1115">In all these ways, they merit our attention.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1119">In New England, the majority acts through representatives when the general affairs of the state must be dealt with. This was necessary; but in the town, where legislative and governmental action is closer to the governed, the law of representation is not accepted.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt573" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt573_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a> There is no town council; the body of voters, after naming their magistrates, directs them in everything that is not the pure and simple execution of the laws of the state.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt574" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt574_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>105<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1120">This state of things is so contrary to our ideas, and so opposed to our habits, that it is necessary to provide a few examples here for it to be well understood.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1121">Public offices are extremely numerous and highly divided in the town, as we will see below. The largest part of administrative powers is concentrated, however, in the hands of a small number of individuals elected annually who are called selectmen.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt576" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt576_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1122">The general laws of the state have imposed a certain number of obligations on the selectmen. To fulfill them they do not need the authorization of those under their jurisdiction, and they cannot avoid their obligations without engaging their personal responsibility. State law charges them, for example, with drawing up the electoral lists in their town; if they fail to do so, they make themselves guilty of a misdemeanor. But in all things that are left to the direction of the town authority, the selectmen are the executors of the popular will, as with us the mayor is the executor of the deliberations of the town council. Most often they act on their private responsibility and, in actual practice, only carry out the implications of principles previously set down by the majority. But if they want to introduce any change whatsoever in the established order, if they desire to pursue a new undertaking, they must return to the source of their power. Suppose that it is a question of establishing a school: the selectmen convoke on a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>106<span class="bracket">]</span></span> given day, in a place specified in advance, the whole body of voters; there, they set forth the need that is felt; they show the means to satisfy it, the money that must be spent, the location that should be chosen. The assembly, consulted on all those points, adopts the principle, determines the location, votes the tax and puts the execution of its will into the hands of the selectmen.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1123">Only the selectmen have the right to call the town meeting, but they can be made to do so. If ten property owners conceive a new project and want to submit it for approval by the town, they call for a general convocation of the inhabitants; the selectmen are obliged to agree to the call and only retain the right to preside over the meeting.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt577" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt577_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1124">Without a doubt, these political mores, these social customs are very far from us. At this moment I want neither to judge them nor to show the hidden causes that produce and animate them; I am limiting myself to presenting them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1125">The selectmen are elected annually in the month of April or May. At the same time the town meeting chooses a host of other town magistrates,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt578" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt578_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> appointed for certain important administrative tasks.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt579" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt579_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> Some, known as assessors, must determine the tax; others, known as collectors, must collect it. One officer, called the <span class="ital">constable,</span> is charged with keeping the peace, supervising public places and assuring the physical execution of the laws. Another, named the town clerk, records all deliberations; he keeps minutes of the acts of the civil registry. A treasurer keeps the town funds. Add to these officers an overseer of the poor, whose duty, very difficult to fulfill, is to enforce the laws relative to the poor; school commissioners, who direct public education; road surveyors, who are responsible for all the routine tasks relating to the roadways, large and small; and you will have the list of the principal agents of town administration. But the division of offices does <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>107<span class="bracket">]</span></span> not stop there. You still find, among the town officers,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt580" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt580_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> parish commissioners who must regulate church expenses;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt581" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt581_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a> inspectors of various kinds, some charged with directing the efforts of citizens in case of fire; others, with overseeing the harvest; these, with temporarily relieving difficulties that can arise from fencing; those, with supervising wood allotments or with inspecting weights and measures.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1126">In all, principal offices in the town number nineteen. Each inhabitant is obligated, under penalty of a fine, to accept these different offices; but also most of these offices are paid,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt582" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt582_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a> so that poor citizens can devote their time to them without suffering a loss. The American system, moreover, does not give any fixed salary to officers. In general, each act of their administration has a value, and they are remunerated only in proportion to what they have done.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt583" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt583_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1128">I said previously that the principle of sovereignty of the people hovers over the entire political system of the Anglo-Americans. Each page of this book will show some new applications of this doctrine.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1129">Among nations where the dogma of the sovereignty of the people reigns, each individual forms an equal portion of the sovereign power, and participates equally in the government of the state.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1130">Each individual is therefore considered to be as enlightened, as virtuous, as strong as any of his fellows.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1131">So why does he obey society, and what are the natural limits of this obedience?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1132">He obeys society, not at all because he is inferior to those who direct it, or less capable than another man of governing himself; he obeys society because union with his fellows seems useful to him and because he knows that this union cannot exist without a regulatory power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1133">So in all that concerns the mutual duties of citizens, he has become a subject. In all that concerns only himself, he has remained the master; he is free and is accountable for his actions only to God. Thus this maxim, that the individual is the best as well as the only judge of his particular interest and that society has the right to direct his actions only when it feels harmed by them, or when it needs to call for his support.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1134">This doctrine is universally accepted in the United States. Elsewhere I will examine what general influence it exercises over even the ordinary acts of life; but at this moment I am talking about the towns.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1135">The town, taken as a whole and in relation to the central government, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>109<span class="bracket">]</span></span> is only an individual like any other to whom the theory I have just indicated applies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1136">Town liberty in the United States follows, therefore, from the very dogma of the sovereignty of the people. All the American republics have more or less recognized this independence; but among the people of New England, circumstances have particularly favored its development.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1137">In this part of the Union, political life was born very much within the towns; you could almost say that at its origin each of them was an independent nation. When the Kings of England later demanded their share of sovereignty, they limited themselves to taking central power. They left the town in the situation where they found it; now the towns of New England are subjects; but in the beginning they were not or were scarcely so. They did not therefore receive their powers; on the contrary, they seem to have relinquished a portion of their independence in favor of the state; an important distinction which the reader must keep in mind.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt584" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt584_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1138">In general the towns are subject to the states only when an interest that I will call <span class="ital">social</span> is concerned, that is to say, an interest that the towns share with others.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt585" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt585_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1139">For everything that relates only to them alone, the towns have remained independent bodies. No one among the inhabitants of New England, I think, recognizes the right of the state government to intervene in the direction of purely town interests.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt586" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt586_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1140">So the towns of New England are seen to buy and sell, to sue and to defend themselves before the courts, to increase or reduce their budget <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>110<span class="bracket">]</span></span> without any administrative authority whatsoever thinking to oppose them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt587" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt587_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a> [&lt;≠This right has only a single limit. That is found in the institution of the judicial power, but we will examine it later.≠&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1141">As for social duties, they are required to fulfill them. Thus, if the state needs money, the town is not free to grant or to deny its cooperation.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt588" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt588_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a> If the state wants to open a road, the town does not have the right to close its territory. If it establishes a regulation concerning public order, the town must execute it. If it wants to organize education according to a uniform plan throughout the country, the town is required to create the schools desired by the law.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt589" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt589_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">9</a> We will see, when we talk about administration in the United States, how and by whom the towns, in all these different cases, are forced to obey. Here I only want to establish the existence of the obligation. This obligation is strict, but the state government, while imposing it, only enacts a principle; for carrying out the principle, the town generally recovers all its rights of individuality. Thus, it is true that the tax is voted by the legislature, but it is the town that apportions and collects it; a school is prescribed, but it is the town that builds, funds and directs it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1142">In France the tax collector of the State levies the taxes of the town; in America the tax collector of the town raises the tax of the state.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1143">With us, therefore, the central government lends its agents to the town; in America, the town lends its officers to the government. That alone makes clear to what degree the two societies differ.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1148">In America not only do town institutions exist, but also a town spirit that sustains and animates them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt590" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt590_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1149">The New England town brings together two advantages that, wherever they are found, strongly excite the interest of men—namely, independence and power. It acts, it is true, within a circle that it cannot leave, but within that circle its movements are free. This independence alone would already give the town real importance even if its population and size would not assure its importance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1150">You must realize that in general the affections of men go only where strength is found. Love of native land does not reign for long in a conquered country.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt591" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt591_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a> The inhabitant of New England is attached to his town, not so much because he was born there as because he sees in this town a free and strong corporate body to which he belongs and which merits the trouble of trying to direct it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1151">In Europe the very people who govern often regret the absence of town spirit; for everyone agrees that town spirit is a great element of order and public tranquillity; but they do not know how to produce it. By making the town strong and independent, they fear dividing social power and exposing the State to anarchy. Now, take strength and independence away <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>112<span class="bracket">]</span></span> from the town, and you will forever find there only people who are administered, not citizens.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1152">Note, moreover, an important fact. The New England town is so constituted that it can serve as a center of strong affections, and at the same time there is nothing nearby that strongly attracts the ambitious passions of the human heart.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1153">The officials of the county are not elected and their authority is limited. The state itself has only a secondary importance; its existence is indistinct and tranquil. To gain the right to administer it, few men agree to distance themselves from the center of their interests and to disrupt their existence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1154">The federal government confers power and glory on those who direct it; but the number of men who are able to influence its destiny is very small. The presidency is a high office that can hardly be attained except after reaching an advanced age. When someone reaches other high level federal offices, it is by chance in a way and after already becoming famous by pursuing another career.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt592" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt592_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a> Ambition cannot make these high offices the permanent aim of its efforts. [{The Union is a nearly ideal being that nothing represents to the mind.}]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt593" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt593_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a> It is in the town, at the center of the ordinary relations of life, that the desire for esteem, the need for real interests, the taste for power and notice are focused. These passions, which so often trouble society, change character when they can operate thus near the domestic hearth and, in a way, within the family.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1155">See with what art, in the American town, care has been taken to <span class="ital">scatter</span> power, if I can express myself in this way, in order to interest more people in public life. Apart from the voters called from time to time to perform the acts of government, how many diverse offices, how many different magistrates, who all, in the circle of their attributions, represent the powerful corporate body in whose name they act! How many men thus <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>113<span class="bracket">]</span></span> exploit the power of the town for their profit and are interested in it for themselves!</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1156">Nor is the American system, even as it divides municipal power among a great number of citizens, afraid to multiply town duties. In the United States people think rightly that love of country is a kind of religious cult that attaches men by observances.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1157">In this way, town life makes itself felt at every moment as it were; it manifests itself every day by the accomplishment of a duty or by the exercise of a right. This political existence imparts a continual, but at the same time peaceful, movement to society that agitates without troubling it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt594" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt594_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1158">The Americans are attached to the city by a reason analogous to the one that makes mountain dwellers love their country. Among them the native land has marked and characteristic features; it has a more distinctive physiognomy than elsewhere.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1159">In general the New England towns have a happy existence. Their government suits their taste and is their choice as well. Within the profound peace and material prosperity that reign in America, the storms of municipal life are few. Leadership of town interests is easy. The political education of the people, moreover, was done a long time ago, or rather they arrived already educated on the soil they occupy. In New England, division of ranks does not exist even in memory; so there is no portion of the town tempted to oppress the other, and injustices, which strike only isolated individuals, are lost in the general contentment. Should the government exhibit some faults, and certainly it is easy to point them out, they are not obvious to view, because the government truly derives from the governed. And it is sufficient for town government to operate, whether well or poorly, for it to be protected by a kind of paternal pride. The Americans, moreover, have no point of comparison. England once ruled the colonies as a whole, but the people have always directed town affairs. So sovereignty of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>114<span class="bracket">]</span></span> people in the town is not only a long-standing condition, but also an original one.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1160">The inhabitant of New England is attached to his town, because it is strong and independent; he is interested in it, because he participates in its leadership; he loves it, because he has nothing to complain about in his lot. In the town he places his ambition and his future; he joins in each of the incidents of town life; in this limited sphere, accessible to him, he tries his hand at governing society. He becomes accustomed to the forms without which liberty proceeds only by revolutions, is infused with their spirit, acquires a taste for order, understands the harmony of powers, and finally gathers clear and practical ideas about the nature of his duties as well as the extent of his rights.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1162">The American county is very analogous to the French <span class="ital">arrondissement.</span> As for the latter, an arbitrary circumscription was drawn for the former; it forms a body whose different parts have no necessary bonds with each other and for whom neither affection nor memory nor shared existence serve as attachments. It is created only for a purely administrative interest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1163">The town was too limited in area ever to contain the administration of justice. The county is, therefore, the primary judicial center. Each county has a court of justice,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt595" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt595_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">10</a> a sheriff to execute the decisions of the courts, a prison that must hold the criminals.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1164">There are needs that are felt in a more or less equal way by all the towns of a county; it was natural that a central authority was charged with providing for them. In Massachusetts, this authority resides in the hands of a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>115<span class="bracket">]</span></span> certain number of magistrates, appointed by the Governor of the state, with the advice<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt596" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt596_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">11</a> of his council.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt597" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt597_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">12</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1165">The county administrators have only a limited and exceptional power that applies only to a very small number of cases provided for in advance. The state and the town are sufficient for the ordinary course of things. These administrators only prepare the county budget; the legislature votes it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt598" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt598_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">13</a> There is no assembly that, directly or indirectly, represents the county.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1166">So truly speaking, the county has no political existence.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt599" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt599_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1167">A double tendency is noticeable in most American constitutions, which leads the law-makers to divide executive power and to concentrate legislative power. The New England town by itself has a principle of existence that is not stripped away from it. But this existence would have to be created artificially in the county, and the usefulness of doing so has not been felt. All the towns united together have only a single representative, the state,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt600" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt600_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a> center of all national powers;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt601" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt601_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a> apart from town and national action, you could say that there are only individual powers.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1169">What most strikes the European who travels across the United States is the absence of what among us we call government or administration. In America, you see written laws; you see their daily execution; everything is in motion around you, and the motor is nowhere to be seen. The hand that runs the social machine escapes at every moment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1170">But just as all peoples, in order to express their thoughts, are obliged to resort to certain grammatical forms that constitute human languages, all societies, in order to continue to exist, are compelled to submit to a certain amount of authority; without it, they fall into anarchy. This authority can be distributed in different ways; but it must always be found somewhere.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1171">There are two means to diminish the strength of authority<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt603" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt603_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> in a nation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1172">The first is to weaken power in its very principle, by taking from society the right or the capacity to defend itself in certain cases; to weaken authority <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>117<span class="bracket">]</span></span> in this way is what, in Europe, is generally called establishing liberty.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt604" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt604_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1173">[{This method has always seemed to me barbaric and antisocial.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1174">There is a second means to diminish the action of authority. This one consists not of stripping society of some of its rights or paralyzing its efforts, but of dividing the use of its powers among several hands; of multiplying officials while attributing to each all the power needed to carry out what he is meant to do. There are peoples who can still be led to anarchy by this division of the social powers; in itself, however, it is not anarchic. By sharing authority in this way, its action is made less irresistible and less dangerous, it is true; but authority is not destroyed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1175">The Revolution in the United States was produced by a mature and thoughtful taste for liberty, and not by a vague and undefined instinct for independence. It was not based upon passions for disorder; on the contrary, it proceeded with love of order and of legality.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt605" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt605_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1176">So in the United States, the Americans did not claim that, in a free country, a man had the right to do everything; on the contrary, social obligations more varied than elsewhere were imposed on him. They did not have the idea of attacking the power of society in its principle and of contesting its rights; they limited themselves to dividing power in its exercise. In this way they wanted to make authority great and the official small, so that society might continue to be well regulated and remain free.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1177">There is no country in the world where the law speaks a language as <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>118<span class="bracket">]</span></span> absolute as in America, nor is there one where the right to apply the law is divided among so many hands.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1178">Administrative power in the United States presents nothing either centralized or hierarchical in its constitution; that is why you do not see it. Power exists, but you do not know where to find its representative.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1179">We saw above that the New England towns were not subordinate. So they take care of their own individual interests.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1180">It is also the town magistrates who are usually charged with seeing to the execution of the general laws of the state or with executing them themselves.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt606" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt606_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">14</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1181">Apart from the general laws, the state sometimes makes general regulations concerning public order. But ordinarily it is the towns and the town officers who, jointly with the justices of the peace and according to the needs of the localities, regulate the details of social existence and promulgate prescriptions relating to public health, good order and the morality of citizens.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt607" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt607_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">15</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1182">Finally it is the municipal magistrates who, by themselves and without needing to wait for outside initiative, provide for the unexpected needs that societies often feel.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt608" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt608_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> <a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt609" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt609_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">16</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>119<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1183">As a result of what we have just said, administrative power in Massachusetts is almost entirely contained within the town;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt610" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt610_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">17</a> but it is divided there among many hands.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1184">In the French town there is in fact only a single administrative official, the mayor.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt611" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt611_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1185">We have seen that there were at least nineteen in the New England town.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1186">The nineteen officers do not generally depend on each other. The law has carefully drawn a circle of action around each of these magistrates. Within this circle, they have all the power needed to fulfill the duties of their office and are not under any town authority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1187">If you look above the town, you see scarcely a trace of an administrative hierarchy. Sometimes county officials correct a decision made by the towns or by the town magistrates,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt612" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt612_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">18</a> but in general you can say that the administrators of the county do not have the right to direct the conduct of the administrators of the town.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt613" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt613_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">19</a> The former have authority over the latter only in things that concern the county.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>120<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1188">The town magistrates and those of the county are required, in a very small number of cases stipulated in advance, to report the result of their actions to the officers of the central government.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt614" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt614_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">20</a> But the central government is not represented by one man charged with making general regulations concerning public order or ordinances for the execution of the laws, with communicating routinely with the administrators of the county and town, with examining their conduct, with directing their actions and punishing their mistakes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1189">So there is no center where the lines of administrative power come together.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1190">Then how do you manage to run society according to a more or less uniform plan? How can counties and their administrators, towns and their officers be made to obey?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt615" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt615_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1191">In the states of New England, the legislative power extends to more objects than with us. The legislator penetrates in a way to the very heart of the administration; the law gets into the smallest details. It simultaneously prescribes the principles and the means to apply them; thus it encloses the secondary bodies and their administrators within a multitude of strict and rigorously defined obligations.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1192">As a result, if all the secondary bodies and all the officials follow the law, all parts of society proceed in a uniform way. But there still remains the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>121<span class="bracket">]</span></span> question of knowing how the secondary bodies and their officials can be forced to follow the law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1193">In a general way you can say that society finds at its disposal only two means to force officials to obey the laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1194">It can entrust to one of the officers the discretionary power to direct all the others and to remove them from office in case of disobedience.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1195">Or it can charge the courts with imposing judicial penalties on those who break the law.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt616" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt616_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1196">You are not always free to choose one or the other of these means.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1197">The right of directing an official assumes the right to remove him from office, if he does not follow the orders given to him, or to promote him if he zealously fulfills all of his duties. Now, an elected magistrate can be neither removed nor promoted. Elective offices are by nature irrevocable until the end of the term. In reality, the elected magistrate has nothing either to hope or to fear except from the voters.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt617" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt617_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a> So when all public offices result from election, there can be no true hierarchy among officials, since both the right to command and the right to quell disobedience effectively cannot be given to the same man; and the power to command cannot be joined with that of rewarding and punishing.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>122<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1198">People who introduce election into the secondary mechanisms of their government are therefore led necessarily to make heavy use of judicial penalties as a means of administration.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1199">This is not obvious at first glance. Those who govern see making offices elective as a first concession, and submitting elected magistrates to the decisions of judges as a second concession. They dread these two innovations equally; and because they are requested to do the first more than the second, they grant the election of the official and leave him independent of the judge. One of these two measures, however, is the only counter balance that can be given to the other. We should be very careful about this; an elective power not submitted to a judicial power escapes sooner or later from all control or is destroyed. Between the central power and elected administrative bodies, only the courts can serve as an intermediary. They alone can force the elected official to obey without violating the right of the voter.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1200">So in the political world, the extension of judicial power must be correlative with the extension of elective power. If these two things do not go together, the State ends by falling into anarchy or servitude.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt618" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt618_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1201">It has been noted in all times that judicial habits prepared men rather poorly for the exercise of administrative power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1202">The Americans took from their fathers, the English, the idea of an institution that has no analogy whatsoever with what we know on the continent of Europe: the justices of the peace.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1203">The justice of the peace holds a middle place between a public figure and the magistrate, administrator and judge. The justice of the peace is an enlightened citizen, but not necessarily one who is versed in knowledge of the laws. Consequently, he is charged only with keeping order in society, something that requires good sense and uprightness more than knowledge. The justice of the peace brings to administration, when he takes part in it, a certain taste for forms and for publicity that makes him a highly troublesome <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>123<span class="bracket">]</span></span> instrument to despotism. But he does not appear to be a slave to those legal superstitions that make magistrates<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt619" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt619_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a> little capable of governing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1204">The Americans appropriated the institution of justices of the peace, all the while removing the aristocratic character that distinguished it in the mother country.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1205">The Governor<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt620" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt620_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a> of Massachusetts<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt621" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt621_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">21</a> appoints, in all the counties, a certain number of justices of the peace, whose term in office lasts seven years.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt622" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt622_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">22</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1206">Among these justices of the peace, moreover, he designates three of them who form in each county what is called the <span class="ital">court of sessions.</span></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1207">The justices of the peace individually take part in public administration. Sometimes, along with the elected officials, they are charged with certain administrative acts;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt623" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt623_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">23</a> sometimes they form a court before which the magistrates <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>124<span class="bracket">]</span></span> summarily charge the citizen who refuses to obey, or the citizen denounces the crimes of the magistrates. But it is in the court of sessions that the justices of the peace exercise the most important of their administrative functions.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1208">The court of sessions meets twice a year at the county seat. In Massachusetts it is charged with upholding the obedience of most<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt624" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt624_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">24</a> of the public officials.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt625" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt625_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">25</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1209">Careful attention must be paid to the fact that in Massachusetts the court of sessions is simultaneously an administrative body strictly speaking and a political court.</p>

<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>125<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1212">We said that the county<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt627" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt627_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">26</a> had only an administrative existence. It is the court of sessions by itself that is in charge of the small number of interests that relate to several towns at the same time or to all the towns of the county at once, interests that consequently cannot be entrusted to any single town in particular.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1213">When it concerns the county, the duties of the court of sessions are therefore purely administrative, and if it often introduces judicial forms into its way of proceeding, it is only as a means to inform itself,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt628" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt628_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">27</a> and as a guarantee given to the citizens. But when the administration of the towns must be ensured, the court of sessions almost always acts as a judicial body, and only in a few rare cases, as an administrative body.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1214">The first difficulty that presents itself is making the town itself, a nearly independent power, obey the general laws of the state.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1215">We have seen that each year the towns must appoint a certain number of magistrates who, as assessors, apportion taxes. A town tries to evade the obligation to pay the tax by not appointing the assessors. The court of sessions imposes a heavy fine.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt629" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt629_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">28</a> The fine is raised by head on all the inhabitants. The county sheriff, officer of the law, executes the decision. In this way, in the United States, power seems eager to hide itself carefully from sight. Administrative command is almost always veiled there as a judicial mandate; as such it is only more powerful, having in its favor the almost irresistible strength that men grant to legal forms.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1216">This procedure is easy to follow and is easily understood. What is required of the town is, in general, clear and defined; it consists of a simple and uncomplicated act, of a principle, and not a detailed application.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt630" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt630_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">29</a> But <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>126<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the difficulty begins when it concerns securing the obedience, not of the town any longer, but of the town officers.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1217">All the reprehensible actions that a public official can commit fall definitively into one of these categories:</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1218">He can do, without enthusiasm and without zeal, what the law requires of him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1219">He cannot do what the law requires of him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1220">Finally, he can do what the law forbids.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1221">A court can get at the conduct of an official only in the last two cases. A positive and appreciable act is needed as grounds for judicial action.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1222">Thus, if the selectmen fail to fulfill the formalities required by law in the case of town elections, they can be fined.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt631" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt631_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">30</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1223">But when the public official fulfills his duty without intelligence, when he obeys the instructions of the law without enthusiasm and without zeal, he is entirely beyond the reach of a judicial body.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1224">In this case, the court of sessions, even when vested with its administrative attributions, is impotent to force him to fulfill all of his obligations. Only fear of removal can prevent these quasi-failings; and the court of sessions does not hold within itself the source of town powers; it cannot remove officials that it does not appoint.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt632" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt632_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1225">In order to make certain, moreover, that there is negligence or lack of zeal, the subordinate official would have to be put under constant supervision. Now, the court of sessions meets only twice a year; it does not conduct inspections; it judges only the reprehensible acts that are brought before it.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>127<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1226">Only the discretionary power to remove public officials can guarantee the kind of enlightened and active obedience on their part that judicial suppression cannot impose.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1227">In France we seek this last guarantee in <span class="ital">administrative hierarchy;</span> in America, they seek it in <span class="ital">election.</span></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1228">Thus to summarize in a few words what I have just explained:</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1229">Should the public official in New England commit a <span class="ital">crime</span> in the exercise of his duties, the ordinary courts are <span class="ital">always</span> called to bring him to justice.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1230">Should he commit an <span class="ital">administrative fault,</span> a purely administrative court is charged with punishing him, and when the matter is serious or urgent the judge does what the official should have done.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt633" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt633_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">31</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1231">Finally, should the same official be guilty of one of those intangible failings that human justice can neither define nor assess, he appears annually before a tribunal from which there is no appeal, that can suddenly reduce him to impotence [{remove him from power without even telling him why}]. His power is lost with his mandate.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1232">Certainly this system encompasses great advantages,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt634" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt634_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a> but in its execution a practical difficulty is encountered that must be noted.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1233">I have already remarked that the administrative tribunal that is called the court of sessions did not have the right to inspect the town magistrates; following a legal term, it can only act when it is <span class="ital">apprised.</span> But that is the delicate point of the system.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1234">The Americans of New England have not established a public prosecutor attached to the court of sessions,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt635" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt635_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">32</a> and you must understand how <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>128<span class="bracket">]</span></span> difficult it would have been for them to establish one. If they had limited themselves to placing a prosecutor at each county seat, and if they had not given him agents in the towns, why would this magistrate have been more informed about what was happening in the county than the members of the court of sessions themselves? If he had been given agents in each town, the power most to be feared,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt636" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt636_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> that of administering through the courts, would have been centralized in his hands. Laws are, moreover, the daughters of habits, and nothing similar existed in English legislation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1235">So the Americans have divided, like all other administrative functions, the right of inspection and the right of complaint.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1236">Under the terms of the law, the members of the grand jury must notify the court, to which they are attached, of crimes of all kinds that might be committed in their county.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt637" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt637_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">33</a> There are certain great administrative crimes that the ordinary public prosecutor must pursue as a matter of course.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt638" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt638_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">34</a> Most often, the obligation to have the offenders punished is imposed on the fiscal officer, charged with collecting the proceeds of the fine; thus the town treasurer is charged with pursuing most of the administrative crimes that are committed in his sight.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1237">But above all, American legislation appeals to individual interest;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt639" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt639_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">35</a> that is the great principle found constantly when you study the laws of the United States.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>129<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1238">American legislators show little confidence in human honesty; but they always assume an intelligent man. So most often they rely on personal interest for the execution of laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1239">Indeed, when an individual is positively and presently hurt by an administrative crime, it is understood that personal interest guarantees the lodging of a complaint.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1240">But it is easy to foresee that, if it concerns a legal prescription that has no utility felt by an individual at the moment, even though the legal prescription is useful to society, each person will hesitate to come forward as accuser. In this way, by a kind of tacit agreement, the laws could fall into disuse.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1241">Thrown into this extremity by their system, the Americans are forced to interest informers by calling them in certain cases to share in the fines.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt640" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt640_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">36</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1242">Dangerous measure that assures the execution of laws by debasing mores.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1243">Above the county magistrates, there is truly no other administrative power, only a governmental power.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1245">I previously announced that, after having examined in detail the constitution of the town and county in New England, I would cast a general glance over the rest of the Union.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1246">There are towns and town life in each state; but in none of the confederated states do you find a town identical to the New England town.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1247">As you move toward the south, you notice that town life becomes less active; the town has fewer magistrates, rights and duties; the population there does not exercise so direct an influence on town affairs; town meetings are less frequent and involve fewer matters. The power of the elected magistrate is therefore comparatively greater and that of the voter, smaller; town spirit there is less awake and less powerful.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt641" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt641_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">37</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1248">You begin to see these differences in the state of New York; they are already very apparent in Pennsylvania; but they become less striking when you move toward the Northwest. Most of the emigrants who go to establish the states of the Northwest come from New England, and they bring the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>131<span class="bracket">]</span></span> administrative habits of their mother land to their adopted country. The Ohio town has much in common with the Massachusetts town.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1249">We have seen that in Massachusetts the principle of public administration is found in the town. The town is the center where the interests and affections of men converge. But it ceases to be so the more you move toward the states where enlightenment is less universally spread and where, consequently, the town offers fewer guarantees of wisdom and fewer elements of administration. So as you move away from New England, town life passes in a way to the county. The county becomes the great administrative center and forms the intermediate power between the [central] government and the ordinary citizens.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1250">I said that in Massachusetts county matters were directed by the court of sessions. The court of sessions is made up of a certain number of magistrates appointed by the Governor and his council. The county has no representation, and its budget is voted by the national [<span class="ital">sic:</span> state] legislature.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1251">In the large state of New York, on the contrary, in the state of Ohio and in Pennsylvania, the inhabitants of each county elect a certain number of deputies; these deputies meet together to form a representative county assembly.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt642" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt642_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">38</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1252">The county assembly possesses, within certain limits, the right to tax the inhabitants; in this regard, it constitutes a true legislature. It simultaneously administers the county, directs the administration of the towns in several instances, and limits their powers much more strictly than in Massachusetts.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt643" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt643_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1253">These are the principal differences presented by the constitution of the town and county in the various confederated states. If I wanted to get into <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>132<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the details of the means of execution, there are still many other dissimilarities that I could point out. But my goal is not to give a course in American administrative law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1254">I have said enough about it, I think, to make the general principles that administration in the United States rests upon understood. These principles are applied in different ways; they have more or less numerous consequences depending on the place; but fundamentally they are the same everywhere. The laws vary; their physiognomy changes; the same spirit animates them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1255">The town and county are not constituted in the same way everywhere; but you can say that everywhere in the United States the organization of the town and county rests on the same idea: that each person is the best judge of what concerns himself alone, and the one most able to provide for his individual needs. So the town and county are charged with looking after their special interests. The state governs and does not administer. Exceptions to this principle are found, but not a contrary principle.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt644" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt644_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1256">The first consequence of this doctrine has been to have all the administrators<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt645" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt645_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a> of the town and county chosen by the inhabitants themselves, or at least to choose these magistrates exclusively from among the inhabitants.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt646" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt646_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1257">[≠The second, to put into their hands the administration [v. direction] of nearly all the interests of the town and county.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1258">The state has retained the power to impose laws on all the towns and counties, but it has not put into the hands of any official the power to direct the administration in a general way.≠]</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>133<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1259">Since administrators everywhere are elected or at least irrevocable, the result has been that rules of hierarchy have not been able to be introduced anywhere. So there are nearly as many independent officials as offices. Administrative power finds itself scattered among a multitude of hands.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1260">Since administrative hierarchy exists nowhere and administrators are elected and irrevocable until the end of their term, the obligation followed to introduce courts, more or less, into the administration. From that comes the system of fines, by means of which the secondary bodies and their representatives are forced to obey the law. This system is found from one end of the Union to the other.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1261">The power of suppressing administrative crimes or of taking administrative actions as needed has not been granted, moreover, to the same judges in all the states.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1262">The Anglo-Americans have drawn the institution of the justices of the peace from a common source; it is found in all the states. But they have not always taken advantage of it in the same way.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1263">Everywhere the justices of the peace take part in the administration of the towns and counties,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt647" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt647_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">39</a> either by administering them directly or by suppressing certain administrative crimes committed in them. But in most states, the most serious of these crimes are submitted to ordinary courts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1264">Election of administrative officials, or irremovability from office, lack of administrative hierarchy, and introduction of judicial measures into the government of society at the secondary level are, therefore, the principal <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>134<span class="bracket">]</span></span> characteristics by which American administration, from Maine to Florida, is recognized.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt649" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt649_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1265">There are some states where signs of administrative centralization begin to be seen. The state of New York is the most advanced along this path.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1266">In the state of New York, officials of the central government exercise, in certain cases, a kind of supervision and control over the conduct of the secondary bodies.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt650" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt650_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">40</a> In certain other cases, they form a type of court of appeal for deciding matters.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt651" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt651_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">41</a> In the state of New York, judicial penalties <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>135<span class="bracket">]</span></span> are used less than elsewhere as an administrative measure. There, the right to bring proceedings against administrative crimes is also placed in fewer hands.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt652" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt652_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">42</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1267">The same tendency is slightly felt in several other states.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt653" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt653_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">43</a> But, in general, you can say that the salient characteristic of public administration in the United States is to be prodigiously decentralized.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1273">The legislative power of the state is entrusted to two assemblies; the first is generally called the senate.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1274">The senate is normally a legislative body; but sometimes it becomes an administrative and judicial body.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1275">It takes part in administration in several ways depending on the different constitutions;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt656" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt656_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">45</a> but ordinarily it enters into the sphere of executive power by taking part in the choice of officials.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1276">It participates in judicial power by judging certain political crimes and sometimes as well by ruling on certain civil actions.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt657" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt657_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">46</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1277">Its members are always few in number.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1278">The other branch of the legislature, usually called the house of representatives, participates in nothing related to administrative power, and takes part in judicial power only when accusing public officials before the senate.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1279">The members of the two houses are subject almost everywhere to the same conditions of eligibility. Both are elected in the same way and by the same citizens.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1280">The only difference that exists between them is due to the fact that the mandate of senators is generally longer than that of representatives. The second rarely remain in office more than a year; the first ordinarily hold their seats two or three years.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1281">By granting senators the privilege of being named for several years, and by replacing them by cohort, the law has taken care to maintain, among the legislators, a nucleus of men, already used to public affairs, who can exercise a useful influence over the newcomers.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>137<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1282">So by the division of the legislative body into two branches, the Americans did not want to create one hereditary assembly and another elective one; they did not intend to make one into an aristocratic body, and the other into a representative of the democracy. Nor was their goal to make the first into a support for the governing power, while leaving the interests and passions of the people to the second.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt659" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt659_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1283">To divide legislative power, to slow in this way the movement of political assemblies, and to create a court of appeal for the revision of laws, such are the only advantages that result from the current constitution of the two houses in the United States.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1284">Time and experience have shown the Americans that, reduced to these advantages, the division of legislative powers is still a necessity of the first order.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1285">Pennsylvania alone, among all the united republics, tried at first to establish a single assembly. Franklin himself, carried away by the logical consequences of the dogma of sovereignty of the people, had worked toward this measure. The law soon had to be changed and two houses established. The principle of the division of legislative power thus received its final consecration; henceforth then, the necessity to divide legislative activity among several bodies can be considered a demonstrated truth. This theory, more or less unknown in the ancient republics, introduced into the world almost by chance, like most great truths, misunderstood among several modern peoples, has finally passed as an axiom into the political science of today.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt660" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt660_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1289">The supreme magistrate, who is called the Governor, is placed alongside the legislature as a moderator and adviser. He is armed with a qualified veto that allows him to stop or at least to slow the legislature’s movements as he wishes.

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1291">When the power of opinion, which men have agreed to grant to the law, is not recognized, the Governor advances at the head of the physical force of the state; he breaks down resistance and reestablishes customary order.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1295">Centralization is a word repeated constantly today, and, in general, no one tries to clarify its meaning.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1296">Two very distinct types of centralization exist, however, that are important to know well.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1297">Certain interests are common to all parts of the nation, such as the formation of general laws and the relationships of the people with foreigners.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1298">Other interests are special to certain parts of the nation, such as town enterprises, for example.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1299">To concentrate in the same place or in the same hands the power to direct the first is to establish what I will call governmental centralization.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt667" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt667_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>144<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1300">To concentrate in the same way the power to direct the second is to establish what I will name administrative centralization.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt668" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt668_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1301">There are points at which these two types of centralization merge. But by taking, as a whole, the matters that fall more particularly in the domain of each of them, we easily manage to distinguish them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt669" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt669_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1302">It is understood that governmental centralization acquires immense strength when it is joined with administrative centralization. In this way, it accustoms men to making a complete and continuous abstraction of their will, to obeying, not once and on one point, but in everything and every day. Then, not only does it subdue them by force, but also it captures them by their habits; it isolates them and then, within the common mass, catches hold of them, one by one.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1303">These two types of centralization lend each other mutual aid, attract each other; but I cannot believe that they are inseparable.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1304">Under Louis XIV, France saw the greatest governmental centralization that could be imagined, since the same man made general laws and had the power to interpret them, represented France to the outside world and acted in its name. <span class="ital">L’Etat, c’est moi,</span> he said; and he was right.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt670" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt670_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>145<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1305">Under Louis XIV, however, there was much less administrative centralization than today.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt671" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt671_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>146<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1306">In our time, we see a power, England, where governmental centralization is carried to a very high degree; the State there seems to move like a single man; at will, it rouses immense masses, gathers and delivers, wherever it wants, the utmost of its strength.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1307">England, which has done such great things for the last fifty years, does not have administrative centralization.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1308">For my part, I cannot imagine that a nation could live or, above all, prosper without strong governmental centralization.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>147<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1309">But I think that administrative centralization is suitable only to enervate the peoples who submit to it, because it constantly tends to diminish the spirit of citizenship in them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt672" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt672_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a> Administrative centralization, it is true, succeeds in gathering at a given time and in a certain place all the available forces of a nation, but it is harmful to the multiplication of those forces. It brings the nation victory on the day of battle and over time reduces its power. So it can work admirably toward the passing greatness of a man, not toward the lasting prosperity of a people.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt673" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt673_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> [&lt;≠I see there an element of despotism, but not of lasting national strength [in pencil: that would be].≠&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1310">You must be very careful; when someone says that a State is unable to act because it has no centralization, he is, without knowing it, almost always talking about governmental centralization.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt674" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt674_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a> The German empire, it is said repeatedly, has never been able to gain all that it possibly could from its forces. Agreed. But why? Because national force has never been centralized there; because the State has never been able to compel obedience to its general laws; because the separate parts of this great body have always had the right or the possibility to refuse their support to the agents of the common authority, even in what concerned all citizens; in other words, because there was no governmental centralization. The same remark applies to the Middle Ages. What produced all the miseries of feudal society was that the power, not only to administer, but also to govern, was divided among a thousand hands and fragmented in a thousand ways; the absence of any governmental centralization then prevented the nations of Europe from moving with energy toward any goal.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>148<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1311">[≠Moreover, like nearly all the harmful things of this world, administrative centralization is easily established and, once organized, can hardly ever be destroyed again except with the social body itself.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt675" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt675_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1312">When all the governmental force of a nation is gathered at one point, it is always easy enough for an enterprising genius to create administrative centralization. We ourselves have seen this phenomenon take place before our eyes. The Convention had centralized government to the highest degree, and Bonaparte needed only to will it in order to centralize the administration. It is true that for centuries in France our habits, mores and laws had always worked simultaneously toward the establishment of an intelligent and enlightened despotism.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt676" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt676_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1313">Once administrative centralization has lasted for a time, should the power that established it sincerely desire to destroy it, that same power almost always finds itself unable to bring about its ruin.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1314">In fact, administrative centralization assumes a skillful organization of authority; it forms a complicated machine in which all the gears fit together and offer mutual support.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1315">When the law-maker undertakes to scatter this administrative power that he has concentrated in a single place, he does not know where to begin, because he cannot remove one piece of the mechanism without disrupting the whole thing. At each moment, he sees that either nothing must be changed or everything; but what hand, so foolhardy, would dare to smash with one blow the administrative machinery of a great people?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1316">To attempt it would be to invite disorder and confusion into the State.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1317">The art of administration is assuredly a science, and peoples do not have more innate knowledge than individuals do. Delivered to itself without any transition, society would almost entirely cease to be administered.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1318">Moreover, one of the greatest misfortunes of despotism is that it creates in the soul of the men submitted to it a kind of depraved taste for tranquillity and obedience, a sort of self-contempt, that ends by making them <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>149<span class="bracket">]</span></span> indifferent to their interests and enemies of their own rights. In nothing, however, is it more necessary for the governed themselves to show a definite and sustained will.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1319">Nearly all the passionate and ambitious men who talk about centralization lack a real desire to destroy it. What happened to the Praetorians happens to them; they willingly suffer the tyranny of the emperor in the hope of gaining the empire. So decentralization, like liberty, is something that the leaders of the people promise, but that they never deliver. In order to gain and keep it, nations can count only on their own efforts; and if they themselves do not have a taste for it, the evil is without remedy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1320">Surprisingly, the same corporations, in whose name the power of self-administration has been passionately claimed, are often seen to accept without enthusiasm the portion of power granted to them and to show themselves almost eager to lay it down again, like a useless and heavy burden.≠]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt677" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt677_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1321">We have seen that in the United States no administrative centralization existed. Scarcely a trace of hierarchy is found there. Decentralization there has been carried to a point that no European nation could bear, I think, without a profound uneasiness, and that, even in America, produces unfortunate effects. But, in the United States, governmental centralization exists to the highest degree. It would be easy to prove that national [<span class="ital">sic:</span> state] power is more concentrated there than it has been in any of the old monarchies of Europe. Not only is there just a single body in each state that makes laws; not only is there just a single power able to create political life around it; but in general, the Americans have avoided bringing together numerous district or county assemblies for fear that these assemblies would be tempted to move beyond their administrative attributions and hinder the movement of the government. In America the legislature of each state is faced by no power capable of resisting it. Nothing can stop it in its tracks, neither privileges, nor local immunity, nor personal influence, not even the authority of reason, for it represents the majority that claims to be the only <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>150<span class="bracket">]</span></span> instrument of reason. So it has no limit to its action other than its own will. Next to it and close at hand is found the representative of the executive power who, with the aid of physical force, has to compel the discontent to obey.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt678" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt678_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1322">Weakness is found only in certain details of governmental action.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1323">The American republics do not have a permanent armed force to suppress minorities, but up to now minorities there have never been reduced to starting a war; and the need for an army has not yet been felt.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt679" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt679_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a> Most often, the state uses town or county officials to act upon the citizens. Thus, for example, in New England, it is the town assessor who apportions the tax; the town tax collector levies it; the town treasurer makes sure that the tax revenue goes into the public treasury; and complaints that arise are submitted to the ordinary courts. Such a way to collect taxes is slow and awkward; at every instant it would hinder the movement of a government that had great pecuniary needs. In general, for everything essential to its existence, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>151<span class="bracket">]</span></span> you would want the government to have officials of its own, chosen and removable by it, and to have ways to move ahead rapidly; but it will always be easy for the central power, organized as it is in America, to introduce more energetic and effective means of action, as needed.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt680" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt680_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1324">So it is not, as is often repeated, because there is no centralization in the United States, that the republics of the New World will perish.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt681" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt681_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a> It can be asserted that the American governments, very far from not being centralized enough, are centralized too much; I will prove it later. Each day the legislative assemblies devour some of the remains of governmental powers; they tend to gather them all unto themselves, just as the Convention did.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt682" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt682_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a> The social power, thus centralized, constantly changes hands, because it is subordinate to popular power. Often it happens to lack wisdom and foresight, because it can do everything. That is where the danger to it is found. So it is because of its very strength, and not as a result of its weakness, that the social power is threatened with perishing one day.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt683" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt683_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>152<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1325">Administrative decentralization produces several diverse effects in America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1326">We have seen that the Americans had almost entirely isolated administration from government; in that, they seem to me to have gone beyond the limits of healthy reason, because order, even in secondary things, is still a national interest.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt684" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt684_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">49</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1327">The state has no administrative officials of its own, who are placed in permanent posts at different points of the territory and to whom it can give a common impulse; the result is that it rarely attempts to establish general rules of public order. Now, the need for these rules makes itself sharply felt. The European often notices their absence. This appearance of disorder, which reigns on the surface, persuades him, at first view, that there is complete anarchy in the society; it is only by examining things in depth that he corrects his error.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1328">[This absence of national (v: central) administration often prevents the different states from engaging in certain undertakings of a general interest, the execution of which would present great difficulties if handed over to the localities and left to temporary and special agents. Besides, it is always to be feared that, without a permanent authority to centralize and supervise, the work, once done, might self-destruct.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1329">As for differences that would make themselves felt between the administrative principles of one portion of the territory and those of another, differences that would be very great in Europe are not noticeable in America. The states are not so vast as to present examples; and above all, their population is too perfectly homogeneous and too enlightened for these differences to be lasting. All the counties, moreover, are forced to obey general laws that are the same for each of them.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>153<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1330">≠I recognize as well that in America the views that direct the administration are rarely permanent. It is difficult to decentralize administrative power without putting a portion of it back into the hands of the people; and the people never proceed except by momentary efforts and sudden impulses.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1331">I come to the great objection that has been made from time immemorial to the system of administrative decentralization, the objection that encompass [<span class="ital">sic</span>] all of the others.≠</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1332">The partisans of centralization in Europe …]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1333">Certain enterprises interest the entire state and yet cannot be carried out because there is no national [<span class="ital">sic:</span> state] administration to direct them. Abandoned to the care of the towns and counties, left to elected and temporary agents, they lead to no result or produce nothing lasting.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1334">The partisans of centralization in Europe maintain that governmental power administers the localities better than they would be able to administer themselves. Perhaps that is true, when the central power is enlightened, and the localities are not; when it is active, and they are passive; when it is in the habit of taking action, and they are in the habit of obeying. You can even understand that the more centralization increases, the more this double tendency grows; and the capacity of the one and incapacity of the other become more striking.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1335">But I deny that this is so when the people are enlightened, alert to their interests, and accustomed to consider them as they do in America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1336">I am persuaded, on the contrary, that in this case the collective strength of the citizens will always be more powerful for producing social well-being than the authority of the government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1337">I admit that it is difficult to indicate with certainty how to awaken a people who are asleep, how to give them the passions and enlightenment that they lack. To persuade men that they should take charge of their own affairs is, I am aware, a difficult enterprise. Often it would be less awkward to interest them in the details of court etiquette than in the repair of their town hall [{and I would conclude, if you want, that there are certain nations [v: peoples] who cannot do without despotism.}].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1338">But I also think that when the central administration claims to replace <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>154<span class="bracket">]</span></span> completely the free participation of those who have the primary interest, it is mistaken or wants to deceive you.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1339">A central power, as enlightened, as skillful as can be imagined, cannot by itself encompass all the details of the life of a great people. It cannot, because such a task exceeds human power. When, on its own, it wants to create and put into operation so many different mechanisms, it either contents itself with a very incomplete result or exhausts itself in useless efforts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1340">Centralization easily manages, it is true, to subject the outward actions of men to a certain uniformity that is ultimately loved for itself, apart from the things to which it is applied; like the devout who worship the statue, forgetting the divinity it represents. Centralization succeeds without difficulty in imparting a steady appearance to everyday affairs; in skillfully dictating the details of social order; in suppressing slight disturbances and small transgressions; in maintaining society in a <span class="ital">status quo</span> which is not exactly either decadence or progress; in keeping a kind of administrative somnolence in the social body that administrators customarily call good order and public tranquillity.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt685" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt685_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">50</a> In a word, it excels at preventing, not at doing. When it is a matter of profoundly shaking society or moving it rapidly, centralization loses its strength. As soon as its measures need the support of individuals, you are totally surprised by the weakness of this immense machine; it suddenly finds itself reduced to impotence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1341">Then sometimes centralization, in desperation, tries to call citizens to its aid. But it says to them: “You will act as I want, as long as I want, and exactly in the way that I want. You will take charge of these details without a spiring to direct the whole; you will work in the shadows, and later you will judge my work by its results.” Under such conditions you do not gain the support <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>155<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of human will, which requires liberty in its ways, responsibility in its actions. Man is made so that he prefers remaining immobile to moving without independence toward an unknown end.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt686" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt686_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1342">[During the almost forty years that we in France have completed the system of administrative centralization, what great improvement has been introduced into the state of the civilization of the people? Who would compare our social progress to that of the English during the same period? But, centralization does not exist in England.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1343">I will not deny that in the United States you often regret the lack of those uniform rules that seem constantly to watch over each of us.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1344">From time to time, great examples of unconcern and of social negligence are found there. Here and there crude blemishes appear that seem completely at odds with the surrounding civilization.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1345">Useful undertakings that require constant care and rigorous exactitude in order to succeed often end up being abandoned; for in America, as elsewhere, the people proceed by momentary efforts and sudden impulses.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt687" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt687_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1346">The European, accustomed to finding an official constantly at hand who gets involved in nearly everything, becomes used to these different mechanisms of town administration with difficulty. In general it can be said that the small details of social order that make life pleasant and easy are neglected in America; but the guarantees essential to man in society exist there as much as everywhere else. Among the Americans, the force that administers the State is much less stable, less enlightened, less skillful, but is one hundred times greater than in Europe. When all is said and done, there is no country in the world where men make as many efforts to create social well-being. I know of no people who have managed to establish schools so numerous and so effective; churches more appropriate to the religious needs of the inhabitants; town roads better maintained. So, in the United States, do not look for uniformity and permanence of views, minute attention to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>156<span class="bracket">]</span></span> details, perfection in administrative procedures.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt688" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt688_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">51</a> What is found there is the image of strength, a little wild, it is true, but full of power; of life, accompanied by accidents, but also by activities and efforts.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt690" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt690_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1347">I will admit, moreover, if you want, that the villages and counties of the United States would be administered more profitably by a central authority that was located far from them and remained unknown to them, than by officials drawn from within. I will acknowledge, if you insist, that more security would reign in America, that wiser and more judicious use of social resources would be made there, if the administration of the entire country were concentrated in a single hand. The political advantages that the Americans gain from the system of decentralization would still make me prefer it to the opposite system.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>157<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1348">So what, after all, if there is an authority always at the ready, [{that muzzles dogs [v: waters public walkways] during the heat wave, that breaks up river ice during the winter}] that makes sure that my pleasures are peaceful, that flies before my steps to turn all dangers aside without the need for me even to think about them; if this authority, at the same time that it removes the smallest thorn from my route, is absolute master of my liberty and life; if it monopolizes movement and existence to such a degree that everything around it must languish when it languishes, sleep when it sleeps, perish if it dies?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1349">There are such nations in Europe where the inhabitant considers himself a sort of settler, indifferent to the destiny of the place where he lives. The greatest changes occur in his country without his participation; he does not even know precisely what happened; he surmises; he has heard about the event by chance. Even more, the fortune of his village, the policing of his street, the fate of his church and his presbytery have nothing to do with him; he thinks that all these things are of no concern to him whatsoever, and that they belong to a powerful stranger called the government. [v: At each moment, you think you hear him say: what concern is this to me; it is the business of the authorities to provide for all of this, not mine.] As for him, he enjoys these benefits like a usufructuary, without a sense of ownership and without ideas of any improvement whatsoever. This disinterestedness in himself goes so far that if his own security or that of his children is finally compromised, instead of working himself to remove the danger, he crosses his arms to wait until the entire nation comes to his aid. Moreover, this man, even though he has so completely sacrificed his own free will, likes to obey no more than anyone else. He submits, it is true, to the will of a clerk; but, like a defeated enemy, he likes to defy the law as soon as power withdraws. Consequently, you see him oscillate constantly between servitude and license.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1350">When nations have reached this point, they must modify their laws and mores or perish, for the source of public virtues has dried up; subjects are still found there, but citizens are seen no more.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1351">I say that such nations are prepared for conquest. If they do not vanish from the world stage, it is because they are surrounded by similar or inferior nations. It is because within them there still remains a kind of indefinable <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>158<span class="bracket">]</span></span> patriotic instinct, I do not know what unthinking pride in the name that the nation carries. It is because there still remains I do not know what vague memory of past glory, not precisely linked to anything, but enough to impart an impulse of preservation as needed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1352">You would be wrong to reassure yourself by thinking that certain peoples have made prodigious efforts to defend a native land where, so to speak, they lived as strangers. Be very careful here, and you will see that in that case religion was almost always their principal motive.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1353">For them, the duration, glory or prosperity of the nation had become sacred dogmas, and by defending their native land, they also defended this holy city in which they were all citizens.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1354">The Turkish populations have never taken any part in the direction of the affairs of society; they accomplished immense enterprises, however, as long as they saw the triumph of the religion of Mohammed in the conquests of the Sultans. Today religion is disappearing; despotism alone remains for them; they are in decline.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt691" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt691_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1355">Montesquieu, by giving despotism a strength of its own, gave it, I think, an honor that it did not deserve. Despotism, all by itself, can sustain nothing lasting. When you look closely, you notice that what made absolute governments prosper for a long time was religion, and not fear.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1356">No matter what, you will never find true power among men except in the free participation of wills.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt692" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt692_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a> Now, in the world, only patriotism or religion <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>160<span class="bracket">]</span></span> can make the totality of citizens march for long toward the same goal.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1357">It does not depend on the laws to revive beliefs that are fading; but it does depend on the laws to interest men in the destinies of their country. It depends on the laws to awaken and to direct that vague patriotic instinct that never leaves the human heart, and, by linking it to thoughts, passions, daily habits, to make it into a thoughtful and lasting sentiment. And do not say that it is too late to try; nations do not grow old in the same way that men do. Each generation born within the nation is like a new people who comes to offer itself to the hand of the law-maker.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1358">What I admire most in America are not the <span class="ital">administrative</span> effects of decentralization, but its <span class="ital">political</span> effects. In the United States, country makes itself felt everywhere. It is an object of solicitude from the village to the whole Union. The inhabitant becomes attached to each of the interests of his country as to his very own. He glories in the glory of the nation; in the successes that it achieves, he believes that he recognizes his own work, and he rises with them; he rejoices in the general prosperity that benefits him. For his country, he has a sentiment analogous to that you feel for your family, and it is even by a kind of egoism that he is interested in the State.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1359">Often the European sees in the public official only force; the American sees the law. So it can be said that in America, a man never obeys a man, but obeys justice or the law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1360">Consequently, he has conceived an often exaggerated, but almost always salutary opinion of himself. Without fear, he relies on his own powers that seem to him all sufficient. An individual conceives the idea of some enterprise; even if this enterprise has some direct connection with the well-being of society, it does not occur to him to address himself to public authority to gain its support. He makes his plan known, offers to carry it out, calls other individual powers to his aid, and struggles hand-to-hand against all obstacles. Often, doubtlessly, he succeeds less than if the State took his place; but in the long run the general result of all of these individual undertakings surpasses by a great deal what the government would be able to accomplish.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt693" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt693_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1361">Since administrative authority is placed next to the administered, and in a way represents them, it excites neither jealousy nor hate. Since its means of action are limited, each person feels that he cannot rely on it alone.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1362">So when the administrative power intervenes within the circle of its attributions, it does not find itself alone, as in Europe. No one believes that the duties of individuals have ceased because the public representative happens to act. On the contrary, each person guides, supports and sustains him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1363">By joining the action of individual powers with the action of social powers, you often succeed in doing what the most concentrated and energetic administration would be unable to carry out.<a href="#n009" id="n009_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">I</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1364">I could cite many facts to support what I am advancing; but I prefer to present only one and to choose the one I know best.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1365">In America, the means put at the disposal of authority to uncover crimes and to pursue criminals are few.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1366">Police control does not exist; passports are unknown. Officers of the court in the United States cannot be compared to ours. The agents of the public prosecutor’s office are few; [they do not communicate with each other;] they do not always have the right to initiate legal proceedings; preliminary investigation is rapid and oral. I doubt, however, that, in any country, crime as rarely escapes punishment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1367">The reason for it is that everyone believes himself interested in providing proof of the crime and in catching the offender.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1368">I saw, during my stay in the United States, the inhabitants of a county, where a great crime had been committed, spontaneously form committees for the purpose of pursuing the guilty party and delivering him to the courts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1369">In Europe, the criminal is an unfortunate who is fighting to hide from the agents of power; the population in a way helps in the struggle. In America, he is an enemy of the human species, and he has all of humanity against him.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1370">I believe provincial institutions useful to all peoples; but none seems to me to have a more real need for these institutions than the one whose social state is democratic.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1371">In an aristocracy, a certain order is sure to be maintained in the midst of liberty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1372">Since those who govern have a great deal to lose, order has a great interest for them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1373">In an aristocracy, it can be said as well that the people are sheltered from the excesses of despotism, because organized forces are always found, ready to resist the despot.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1374">A democracy without provincial institutions possesses no guarantee against similar evils.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1375">How can a multitude that has not learned how to make use of liberty in small things, be made to support it in larger ones?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1376">How to resist tyranny in a country where each individual is weak, and where individuals are united by no common interest?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1377">So those who are afraid of license and those who fear absolute power must equally desire the gradual development of provincial liberties.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt694" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt694_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1378">I am convinced, moreover, that there are no nations more at risk of falling under the yoke of administrative centralization than those whose social state is democratic.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1379">Several causes lead to this result, but among others, these:</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1380">The permanent tendency of these nations is to concentrate all governmental power in the hands of the single power that directly represents the people, because, beyond the people, nothing more is seen except equal individuals merged into a common mass.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>163<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1381">Now, when the same power is already vested with all the attributes of government, it is highly difficult for it not to try to get into the details of administration [{so you often see democratic peoples simultaneously establish liberty and the instruments of despotism}]; and it hardly ever fails to find eventually the opportunity to do so. We have witnessed it among ourselves.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1384">In the old monarchy, the King alone made the law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1385">Below the sovereign power were found some remnants, half destroyed, of provincial institutions. These provincial institutions were incoherent, poorly ordered, often absurd. In the hands of the aristocracy, they had sometimes been instruments of oppression.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1386">The Revolution has declared itself against royalty and provincial institutions at the same time. It has mingled in the same hatred all that had preceded it, absolute power and what could temper its rigors; it has been simultaneously republican and centralizing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1387">This double character of the French Revolution is a fact that the friends of absolute power have laid hold of with great care. When you see them defend administrative centralization, do you think that they are working in favor of despotism? Not at all; they are defending one of the great conquests of the Revolution.<a href="#n010" id="n010_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">K</a> In this way, they can remain a man of the people and an enemy of the rights of the people, secret servant of tyranny, and declared friend of liberty.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt700" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt700_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1388">I have visited the two nations that have developed the system of provincial liberties to the highest degree, and I have heard the voice of the parties dividing these nations.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1389">In America, I found men who secretly longed to destroy the democratic institutions of their country. In England, I found others who openly attacked the aristocracy; I did not meet a single one who did not view provincial liberty as a great good.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt701" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt701_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1390">In these two countries, I saw the ills of the State imputed to an infinity of diverse causes, but never to town liberty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1391">I heard citizens attribute the greatness or the prosperity of their native land to a multitude of reasons; but I heard all of them put provincial liberty in the first rank and list it at the head of all the other advantages.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1392">When men, who are naturally so divided that they do not agree on either religious doctrines or on political theories, fall into agreement on a single <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>166<span class="bracket">]</span></span> fact, a fact that they can best judge, since it occurs everyday before their eyes, am I to believe that this fact might be wrong?</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1395">I have thought that a separate chapter must be devoted to the judicial power. Its political importance is so great that it seemed to me that talking about it in passing would diminish it in the eyes of readers.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1396">There have been confederations elsewhere than in America; we have seen republics in places other than on the shores of the New World; the representative system is adopted in several States in Europe; but I do not think that until now any nation in the world has constituted the judicial power in the same way as the Americans.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt704" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt704_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1397">[≠The Americans have established the judicial power as counterbalance and barrier to the legislative power. They have made it a political power of the first order.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1398">What is most difficult for a foreigner to understand in the United States is the judicial organization. There is, so to speak, no political event in which he does not hear the authority of the judge invoked; and he naturally concludes that in the United States the judge is one of the premier political powers. Then when he comes to examine the constitution of the courts, he discovers at first view only judicial attributions and habits. In his eyes, the magistrate seems never to get into public affairs except by chance; but this very chance recurs daily.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1399">When the Parlement of Paris made remonstrances and refused to register an edict, when on its own it summoned a corrupt official to appear before it, the political action of the judicial power could be recognized. But nothing similar is seen in the United States. [{The American judge never enters <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>169<span class="bracket">]</span></span> into direct conflict [v: is never found battling] with the political powers strictly defined.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1400">The Americans have kept all the characteristics by which the judicial power is customarily recognized. They have enclosed it exactly within the circle where it habitually moves.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1401">The first characteristic of the judicial power, among all peoples, is to serve as arbiter. For the courts to take action, a case must be brought. For there to be a judge, there must be proceedings. As long as a law does not give rise to a case, the judicial power has no occasion to get involved with it. The judicial power is there, but it doesn’t see the law. When a judge, as part of a trial, attacks a law relating to the trial, he extends the circle of his attributions, but he does not go beyond them, since in a way he must judge the law in order to be able to judge the trial. When he delivers a verdict on a law, outside of a trial, he goes completely beyond his sphere and enters into that of the legislative power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1402">The second characteristic of the judicial power is to deliver a verdict concerning particular cases and not concerning general principles. Should a judge, while deciding a particular question, make it certain that each of the consequences of the same principle is struck down in the same way, the principle becomes sterile. While destroying the general principle in this way, he remains within the natural circle of his action. But should a judge directly attack the general principle and destroy it without having a particular case in view, he goes beyond the circle where all peoples have agreed to enclose him; he becomes something more important, perhaps more useful than a magistrate, but he ceases to represent the judicial power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1403">The third characteristic of the judicial power is to be able to act only when it is called upon, or, following the legal expression, when it is apprised. This characteristic is not found as generally as the other two. I believe, however, that, despite exceptions, it can be considered as essential. By its nature, the judicial power is passive; to stir, it must be put in motion. Someone denounces a crime before it and it punishes the guilty; someone calls upon it to redress an injustice and it redresses it; someone submits an act to it and it interprets it; but it does not go on its own to pursue criminals, seek out injustice and examine facts. In a way the judicial power would do violence <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>170<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to this passive nature if it took initiative on its own and set itself up as censor of the laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1404">[&lt;Two things must not be confused. The same man can be vested with political and judicial powers without thereby mingling political and judicial power. The mind sees them as distinct in the very midst of the confusion of actions. When the Parlement of Paris issued decisions, registered edicts and made regulations for public order, it formed only a single body; but within it three different powers were easily distinguished&gt;.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1405">The Americans have kept these three distinctive characteristics for the judicial power. The American judge can deliver a verdict only when there is a lawsuit. He can never get involved except in a particular case; and to act he must always wait to be apprised.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1406">So the American judge perfectly resembles the magistrates of other nations. He is vested, however, with an immense political power [that the latter do not have. His power forms the most formidable barrier to the encroachments of the legislature].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1407">What causes that? He moves within the same circle and uses the same means as other judges; why does he possess a power that the latter do not have?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1408">The cause is this single fact: the Americans have recognized the right of judges to base their decisions on the <span class="ital">constitution</span> rather than on the <span class="ital">laws.</span> In other words, they have allowed them not to apply laws that would appear unconstitutional to them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1409">I know that a similar right has sometimes been claimed by the courts of other countries; but it has never been granted to them. In America, it is recognized by all powers; no party, not even a man is met who contests it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1410">The explanation for this must be found in the very principle of American constitutions.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1411">In France, the constitution is, or is considered to be, an immutable work.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt705" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt705_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> No power can change anything in it; such is the accepted theory.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt706" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt706_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> <a href="#n011" id="n011_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">L</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>171<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1412">In England, Parliament is recognized to have the right to modify the constitution. In England, therefore, the constitution can change constantly, or rather it does not exist at all. Parliament is, at the same time, the legislative body and the constituent body.<a href="#n012" id="n012_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">M</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1413">In America, political theories are simpler and more rational.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1414">An American constitution is not considered to be immutable, as in France; it cannot be modified by the ordinary powers of society, as in England. It forms a work apart that, representing the will of all the people, binds legislators as well as ordinary citizens; but it can be changed by the will of the people following established forms and in cases for which provisions have been made.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1415">So in America, the constitution can vary; but as long as it exists, it is the source of all powers. Predominant force resides in it alone.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1416">It is easy to see how these differences must influence the position and rights of the judicial body in the three countries that I have cited.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1417">If, in France, the courts could disobey the laws on the grounds that they found them unconstitutional, the constituent power would actually be in their hands, since they alone would have the right to interpret a constitution whose terms no one could change. They would therefore take the place of the nation and would dominate society, at least in so far as the inherent weakness of the judicial power would allow them to do so.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt707" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt707_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>172<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1418">I know that by denying judges the right to declare laws unconstitutional, we indirectly give the legislative body the power to change the constitution, since it no longer encounters a legal barrier that stops it. But better to grant the power to change the constitution of the people to men who imperfectly represent the will of the people, than to others who represent only themselves.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1419">It would be still more unreasonable to give English judges the right to resist the will of the legislative body, because Parliament, which makes the law, makes the constitution as well, and because, as a result, a law cannot <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>173<span class="bracket">]</span></span> in any case be called unconstitutional when it issues from the three powers. Neither of these two arguments applies to America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1420">In the United States, the constitution dominates the legislators as well as ordinary citizens. It is, therefore, the highest law and cannot be modified by a law. So it is right that the courts obey the constitution in preference to all laws [and by doing so, they do not make themselves masters of society since the people, by changing the constitution, can always reduce the judges to obedience. So American judges refuse without hesitation to apply laws that seem to them contrary to the constitution]. This follows from the very essence of the judicial power: to choose from among legal provisions those that bind him most strictly is in a way the natural right of the magistrate.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1421">In France, as well, the constitution is the highest law, and judges have an equal right to base their decisions on it. But by exercising this right, they would not be able to avoid encroaching upon another right still more sacred than theirs: that of the society in whose name they act. Here ordinary reason must yield to reason of state.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt709" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt709_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1422">In America, where the nation can always reduce magistrates to obedience by changing its constitution, a similar danger is not to be feared. On this point, therefore, politics and logic are in agreement, and the people as well as the judges equally retain their privileges.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1423">When a law that the judge considers contrary to the constitution is invoked before the courts of the United States, he can refuse to apply it. This power is the only one particular to the American magistrate, but a great political influence follows from it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1424">There are, in fact, very few laws that can by nature escape judicial analysis for long, for there are very few of them that do not harm an individual interest, and that litigants cannot or must not cite before the courts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1425">Now, from the day when the judge refuses to apply a law in a trial, it <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>174<span class="bracket">]</span></span> instantly loses part of its moral force. Those who have been wronged by the law are then alerted that a way exists to escape the obligation to obey it; trials multiply, and it becomes powerless. Then one of these two things happens: the people change the constitution or the legislature revokes its law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1426">So the Americans have given their courts an immense political power; but by forcing them to challenge laws only by judicial means, they have greatly diminished the dangers of this power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1427">If the judge had been able to challenge laws in a theoretical and general fashion; if he had been able to take the initiative and censure the legislator, he would have burst upon the political scene. Having become the champion or the adversary of one party, he would have called upon all the passions that divide the country to join in the struggle. But when the judge challenges a law in an obscure debate and on a particular application, he partially conceals the importance of the challenge from the eyes of the public. His decision intends only to strike an individual interest; the law is harmed only by chance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1428">The law censured in this way, moreover, is not destroyed; its moral force is lessened, but its material effect is not suspended. Only little by little, and under the repeated blows of jurisprudence, does it finally succumb. [{If the law were challenged directly it would triumph or succumb in a day.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1429">Furthermore, it is easily understood that by charging individual interest with provoking the censure of laws, by intimately linking the trial of the law to the trial of a man, you assure that legislation will not be lightly challenged. In this system legislation is no longer exposed to the daily aggression of parties. By pointing out the mistakes of the legislator, you obey a real need; you start with a definite and appreciable fact, since it must serve as the basis for a trial.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1430">I do not know whether the way in which the American courts act, at the same time that it is most favorable to public order, is not most favorable to liberty as well.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1431">If the judge could challenge the legislators only head on, there are times when he would be afraid to do so; there are other times when partisan spirit would push him daily to dare to do so. Thus the laws would be challenged when the power from which they came was weak, and you would submit <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>175<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to them in silence when that power was strong. That is to say that the laws would often be challenged when respect for them would be most useful, and would be respected when oppression in their name would become easy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt710" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt710_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1432">But the American judge is led onto political terrain despite himself. He judges the law only because he has a trial to judge and cannot avoid judging the trial. The political question that he must resolve is linked with the interest of the litigants, and he cannot refuse to settle it without committing a denial of justice. By fulfilling the strict duties imposed on the profession of magistrate, he performs the act of a citizen. It is true that judicial censure, exercised by the courts on legislation, cannot be extended in this way to all laws without distinction, for there are some that can never give rise to this kind of clearly formulated dispute that is called a trial. And when such a dispute is possible, it is still conceivable that there will be no one who wants to submit it to the courts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1433">The Americans have often felt this drawback, but they have left the remedy incomplete for fear of making it dangerously effective in all cases.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1434">Enclosed within its limits, the power granted to the American courts to rule on the unconstitutionality of laws still forms one of the most powerful barriers that has ever been raised against the tyranny of political assemblies.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt711" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt711_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>

<div id="lf1593-01_argument_018" class="argument">
<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1435"><span class="ital">In the United States, all citizens have the right to accuse public officials before ordinary courts.—How they exercise this right.—Art. 75 of the French constitution of the year VIII.—The Americans and the English cannot understand the sense of this article.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1436">I do not know if I need to say that among a free people, like the Americans, all citizens have the right to accuse public officials before ordinary judges, and that all judges have the right to condemn public officials, it is so natural a thing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1437">To allow the courts to punish agents of the executive power when they violate the law is not giving the courts a particular privilege. To forbid them to do so is taking away a natural right.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1438">It did not appear to me that in the United States, by making all officials responsible to the courts, the forces of government had been weakened.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1439">It seemed to me, on the contrary, that the Americans, by acting in this way, had increased the respect that is owed to those who govern, the latter being much more careful to avoid criticism.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1440">Nor did I observe in the United States that many political trials were instituted, and it is easily explained. A trial is always, whatever its nature, a difficult and costly enterprise. It is easy to accuse a public man in the newspapers, but it is not without grave motives that someone decides to bring him before the law. So to bring legal proceedings against an official, it is necessary to have just grounds of complaint; and officials hardly provide such grounds when they fear having proceedings brought.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1441">This does not result from the republican form that the Americans have adopted, for the same experience can occur every day in England.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1442">These two peoples did not believe that their independence had been assured by allowing the principal agents of power to be put on trial. Instead, they thought that they succeeded in guaranteeing liberty, much more by small trials, placed daily within the reach of the least citizen, than by great proceedings that were never used or were used too late.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>177<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1443">In the Middle Ages, when it was very difficult to reach criminals, judges, when they got hold of some of them, often inflicted terrible punishments on these unfortunates; this did not reduce the number of those guilty. Since then, we have discovered that by making justice both more certain and milder, we have made it more effective at the same time.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1444">The Americans and the English think that arbitrariness and tyranny must be treated like theft: make it easier to take legal action and make the penalty more mild.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1445">In the year VIII of the French Republic, a constitution appeared whose article 75 was worded thus: “The agents of the government, other than the ministers, cannot have legal proceedings instituted against them for facts relating to their functions, except by virtue of a decision of the <span class="ital">Conseil d’É</span><span class="sub">tat;</span> in this case, the proceedings take place before the ordinary courts.”</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1446">The constitution of the year VIII passed from the scene, but not this article, which remained after it [{and we are still so inexperienced in the art of [being (ed.)] free.}]; and it is still used every day to oppose the just complaints of citizens.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1447">[{But this is particular to France.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1448">I have often tried to explain the sense of this art. 75 to some Americans or Englishmen, and it has always been very difficult for me to succeed in doing so.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1449">What they noticed first was that the <span class="ital">Conseil d’É</span><span class="sub">tat,</span> in France, was a high court seated at the center of the kingdom; there was a kind of tyranny in sending all complainants before it as a preliminary step.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1450">But when I tried to make them understand that the <span class="ital">Conseil d’É</span><span class="sub">tat</span> was not a judicial body at all, in the ordinary sense of the term, but an administrative body, whose members were dependent on the King; and that the King, as sovereign, after ordering one of his servants, called prefect, to commit a wrongful act, could order, as sovereign, another of his servants, called councilor of the <span class="ital">Conseil d’É</span><span class="sub">tat,</span> to prevent someone from having the first punished; when I showed them the citizen harmed by the order of the prince, reduced to asking the prince himself for the authorization to seek justice, they refused to believe in such enormities and accused me of lying and of ignorance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1451">Often, in the old monarchy, the <span class="ital">parlement</span> ordered the arrest of the public official who made himself guilty of a crime. Sometimes the royal authority, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>178<span class="bracket">]</span></span> intervening, had the procedure annulled. Despotism then showed itself openly, and people, while obeying, submitted only to force.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1452">So we have retreated far from the point reached by our fathers; for we allow, under the color of justice, and consecrate, in the name of law, deeds that violence alone imposed on them.</p>

<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1453"><span class="ital">What the author understands by political jurisdiction.—How political jurisdiction is understood in France, England and the United States.—In America, the political judge concerns himself only with public officials.—He orders dismissals rather than punishments.—Political jurisdiction, customary method of government.—Political jurisdiction, as understood in the United States, is, despite its mildness, and perhaps because of it, a very powerful weapon in the hands of the majority.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1454">[≠Political jurisdiction is a violation of the great principle of the separation of powers; you resort to it as an extreme measure to reach certain guilty individuals.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1455">I understand by political jurisdiction the decision delivered by a political body temporarily vested with the right to judge.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1456">In absolute governments, it is useless to give judgments extraordinary forms. The prince, in whose name the accused is prosecuted, is master of the courts as of everything else, and he has no need to seek a guarantee beyond the idea that is held of his power.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt713" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt713_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a> The only fear that he can imagine <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>180<span class="bracket">]</span></span> is that not even the external appearances of justice are kept, and that his authority is dishonored in the desire to assert it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1457">But in most free countries, where the majority can never act on the courts as an absolute prince would, judicial power is sometimes placed temporarily in the hands of the very representatives of society. Temporarily mixing powers in this way is preferred to violating the necessary principle of the unity of government. England, France and the United States have introduced political jurisdiction into their laws; it is curious to examine how these three great peoples have turned it to good account.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1458">In England and in France, the chamber of peers forms the highest criminal court<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt714" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt714_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> of the nation. It does not judge all political crimes, but it can do so.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1459">Alongside the chamber of peers is another political power, vested with the right to accuse. On this point, the only difference that exists between the two countries is this: in England, the members of the House of Commons can accuse whomever they choose before the Lords; while in France the deputies can only prosecute the ministers of the King in this way.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt715" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt715_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1460">In these two countries, moreover, the chamber of peers finds all the penal laws at its disposal for striking the delinquents.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1461">In the United States, as in Europe, one of the two branches of the legislature is vested with the right to accuse, and the other with the right to judge. The representatives denounce the guilty party; the Senate punishes him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1462">But a matter can be <span class="ital">referred</span> to the Senate only by the <span class="ital">representatives;</span> and before the Senate, the representatives can accuse only <span class="ital">public officials.</span> Therefore the Senate has a more limited competence than the French court of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>181<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the peers, and the representatives have a broader right to accuse than our deputies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1463">But here is the greatest difference that exists between America and Europe. In Europe, political courts can apply all the provisions of the penal code. In America, when they have removed from the guilty party the public character with which he was vested, and have declared him unworthy to hold any political offices whatsoever in the future, their right is exhausted, and the task of the ordinary courts begins.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1464">I suppose that the President of the United States has committed a crime of high treason.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1465">The House of Representatives accuses him; the senators decide his removal. Afterward he appears before a jury that alone can take away life or liberty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1466">This succeeds in throwing a bright light on the subject that occupies us.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1467">By introducing political jurisdiction into their laws, Europeans wanted to reach great criminals whatever their birth, rank or power in the State. To achieve that, they temporarily united, within a great political body, all the prerogatives of the courts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1468">The legislator is then transformed into a magistrate; he can establish the crime, classify and punish it. By giving him the rights of the judge, the law imposed all of the judge’s obligations on him, and bound him to the observation of all the forms of justice.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1469">When a political court, French or English, has a public official as a defendant and delivers a verdict condemning him, by doing so, it removes him from office and can declare him unworthy to hold any office in the future. But here the dismissal and political interdiction are a consequence of the decision and not the decision itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1470">So in Europe, political jurisdiction is more a judicial act than an administrative measure.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1471">The opposite is seen in the United States, and it is easy to be persuaded that political jurisdiction there is more an administrative measure than a judicial act.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1472">It is true that the decision of the Senate is judicial in form; to make it, the senators are obliged to conform to the solemnity and customs of the procedure. It is also judicial by the grounds on which it is based; the Senate <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>182<span class="bracket">]</span></span> is, in general, obliged to base its decision on a crime of the common law. But it is administrative in its objective.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1473">If the principal aim of the American law-maker had really been to arm a political body with a great judicial power, he would not have restricted its action to the circle of public officials, for the most dangerous enemies of the State may hold no office at all. This is true above all in republics, where the favor of parties is the first of powers, and where someone is often much stronger when not legally exercising any power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1474">If the American law-maker had wanted to give society itself, like judges, the right to prevent great crimes by fear of punishment, he would have put at the disposal of the political courts all the resources of the penal code. But he only provided them with an incomplete weapon that cannot reach the most dangerous of criminals. For what use is a judgment of political interdiction against someone who wants to overturn the laws themselves?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1475">The principal aim of political jurisdiction in the United States is, therefore, to withdraw power from someone who is making poor use of it, and to prevent the same citizen from being vested with power in the future. That, as we see, is an administrative act that has been given the solemnity of a judgment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1476">So in this matter, the Americans have created something mixed. They have given all the guarantees of political jurisdiction to administrative dismissal, and they have removed from political jurisdiction its greatest rigors.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1477">This point settled, everything closely follows; we then discover why the American constitutions submit all civil officials to the jurisdiction of the Senate, and exempt the military whose crimes are, however, more to be feared [{in republics}]. In the civil order, the Americans have, so to speak, no removable officials; some are irremovable; others hold their rights by a mandate that cannot be abrogated. So to remove them from power, they must all be judged.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt716" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt716_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> But military officers depend on the head <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>183<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of State, who himself is a civil officer. By reaching the head of State, they strike them all with the same blow.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt717" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt717_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1478">Now, if we come to compare the European and American systems in the effects that each produces or can produce, we discover differences no less noticeable.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1479">In France and in England, political jurisdiction is considered as an extraordinary weapon that society should use only to save itself in moments of great peril.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1480">We cannot deny that political jurisdiction, as understood in Europe, violates the conservative principle of the separation of powers and constantly threatens the life and liberty of men.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1481">Political jurisdiction in the United States strikes only an indirect blow at the principle of separation of powers. It does not threaten the existence of citizens; it does not, as in Europe, hang over all heads, since it strikes only those who, by accepting public offices, subject themselves to its rigors in advance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1482">It is simultaneously less to be feared and less effective.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1483">Moreover, the law-makers of the United States did not consider it as an extreme remedy for the great ills of society, but as a customary means of government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1484">From this point of view, it perhaps exercises more real influence over the social body in America than in Europe. You must not in fact be fooled by the apparent mildness of the American legislation regarding political jurisdiction. It must be noted, in the first place, that in the United States the court that delivers these judgments is composed of the same elements and is subject to the same influences as the body charged with accusing; this gives an almost irresistible impulse to the vindictive passions of parties. If political judges, in the United States, cannot order punishments as severe as those ordered by political judges in Europe, there is less chance of being acquitted by them as a result. Conviction is less to be feared and more certain.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1485">Europeans, by establishing political courts, had as their principal object <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>184<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to <span class="ital">punish</span> the guilty; Americans, to <span class="ital">remove</span> them from power. Political jurisdiction in the United States is a preventive measure in a way. So judges there must not be bound by very exact criminal definitions.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1486">Nothing is more frightening than the vagueness of American laws, when they define political crimes strictly speaking. The crimes that will justify the conviction of the President, says the Constitution of the United States, section IV, art. I [<span class="ital">sic:</span> Article II, Section 4], are “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Most of the state constitutions are even more obscure.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1487">“Public officials, says the constitution of Massachusetts,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt718" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt718_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> will be condemned for their culpable behavior and for their bad administration.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt719" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt719_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> All officials who put the State in danger by bad administration, corruption or other misdemeanors, says the constitution of Virginia, are impeachable by the House of Delegates.” There are constitutions that, in order to let an unlimited responsibility weigh upon the public officials, specify no crime.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt720" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt720_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1488">But what makes the American laws in this matter so formidable arises, I dare say, from their very mildness.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1489">We have seen that in Europe the dismissal of an official, and his political interdiction, were consequences of the penalty, and that in America it was the penalty itself. The result is this. In Europe, the political courts are vested with terrible rights that sometimes they do not know how to use; and it happens that they do not punish for fear of punishing too much. But in America, they do not back away from a penalty that humanity does not bemoan. To condemn a political enemy to death, in order to remove him from power, is in everybody’s eyes a horrible assassination. To declare an adversary unworthy to possess this same power and to take it away from him, while leaving him his life and liberty, can appear as the honest outcome of the struggle.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1490">Now, this judgment, so easy to decide, is nonetheless the height of misfortune for the ordinary man among those to whom it is applied. Great criminals will undoubtedly defy its empty rigors; ordinary men will see in it a decision that destroys their position, stains their honor, and that condemns them to a shameful inaction worse than death.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1491">So the less formidable political jurisdiction in the United States seems, the greater the influence it exercises on the course of society. It does not act directly on the governed, but it makes the majority entirely master of those who govern. It does not give the legislature an immense power that could be exercised only in a day of crisis; it allows the legislature to have a moderate and regular power that can be used every day. If the power is less, on the other hand, its use is more convenient and its abuse easier.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1492">By preventing political courts from ordering judicial punishments, the Americans seem to me therefore to have avoided the most horrible consequences of legislative tyranny, rather than tyranny itself. And all things considered, I do not know if political jurisdiction, as it is understood in the United States, is not the most formidable weapon ever put in the hands of the majority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1493">When the American republics begin to degenerate, I believe that it will be easy to recognize; it will be enough to see if the number of cases of political jurisdiction increases.<a href="#n013" id="n013_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">N</a></p>

Laws act only in two ways, either by their long duration, when a power superior to society manages to impose them over many years, or by their perfect harmony with the mores, habits and civilization of the people. In this last case, the laws are only the conspicuous and legal manifestation of a preexistent fact.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt723" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt723_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1499">The thirteen colonies that simultaneously threw off the yoke of England at the end of the last century had, as I have already said, the same religion, the same language, the same mores, nearly the same laws; they struggled against a common enemy. So they must have had strong reasons to unite closely together, and to be absorbed into one and the same nation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1500">But each of them, having always had a separate existence and a government close at hand, had created particular interests as well as customs; and each found repugnant a solid and complete union that would have made its individual importance disappear within a common importance. From that, two opposing tendencies: one that led the Anglo-Americans to unite; the other that led them to separate.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1501">As long as the war with the mother country lasted, necessity made the principle of union prevail. And, although the laws that constituted the union were defective, the common bond continued to exist in spite of them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt724" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt724_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>

Each colony, having become an independent republic, seized full sovereignty. The federal government, condemned by its very constitution to weakness, and no longer supported by the feeling of public danger, saw its flag abandoned to the outrages of the great peoples of Europe. At the same time, it could not find sufficient resources to stand up to the Indian nations and to pay the interest on debts contracted during the war for independence. About to perish, it officially declared its own impotence and summoned the constituent power.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt726" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt726_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1504">For a people to struggle energetically to conquer its independence is a spectacle that every century has been able to provide. The efforts made by the Americans to escape from the yoke of the English have, moreover, been much exaggerated. Separated from their enemies by 1,300 leagues of ocean, aided by a powerful ally, the United States owed their victory to their position much more than to the merit of their armies or to the patriotism of their citizens.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt728" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt728_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> Who would dare to compare the American war to the wars of the French Revolution, and the efforts of the Americans to ours? France, the object of attacks from the whole of Europe, without money, credit, allies, threw one-twentieth of its population before its enemies, with one hand putting out the conflagration that devoured its bowels and with the other carrying the torch abroad.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt729" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt729_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> But what is new in the history of societies is to see a great people, warned by its legislators that the gears of government are grinding to a halt, turn its attention to itself, without rushing and without fear; sound the depth of the trouble; keep self-control for two whole years, in order to take time to find the remedy; and, when this remedy is indicated, voluntarily submit to it without costing humanity either a tear or a drop of blood.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1505">When the insufficiency of the first federal constitution made itself felt, the excitement of the political passions that had given birth to the revolution was partially calmed, and all the great men that it had created still lived. This was double good fortune for America. The small assembly,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt730" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt730_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>190<span class="bracket">]</span></span> which charged itself with drafting the second constitution, included the best minds and most noble characters that had ever appeared in the New World. George Washington presided over it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt732" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt732_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1506">This national commission, after long and mature deliberations, finally offered to the people for adoption the body of organic laws that still governs the Union today.

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1508">A first difficulty must have presented itself to the minds of the Americans. It was a question of sharing sovereignty in such a way that the different states that formed the Union continued to govern themselves in everything that related only to their internal prosperity, and that the whole nation, represented by the Union, did not cease to be a body and to provide for all its general needs. A complex question, difficult to resolve.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt735" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt735_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1509">It was impossible to set in advance, in an exact and complete manner, the portion of power that had to revert to each of these two governments that were going to share sovereignty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1510">Who would be able to anticipate in advance all the details of the life of a people?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1511">The duties and rights of the federal government were simple and easy enough to define, because the Union had been formed for the purpose of meeting a number of great general needs. The duties and rights of the government of the states were, on the contrary, numerous and complicated, because this government penetrated into all the details of social life.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1512">So the attributions of the federal government were defined with great care,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt736" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt736_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a> and everything that was not included in the definition was declared to be part of the attributions of the government of the states. Thus, the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>192<span class="bracket">]</span></span> government of the states remained the normal law; the federal government was the exception.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt738" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt738_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1513">But it was anticipated that, in practice, questions could arise relative to the exact limits of this exceptional government, and that it would be dangerous to abandon the solution of these questions to the ordinary courts established in the different states, by the states themselves. So a high federal court,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt739" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt739_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a> a single tribunal, was created; one of its attributions was to maintain the division of powers between the two rival governments as the Constitution had established it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt740" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt740_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a></p>

</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1515">Peoples in relation to one another are only individuals. Above all, a nation needs a single government to appear with advantage in regard to foreigners.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1516">So the Union was granted the exclusive right to make war and peace; to conclude treaties of commerce; to raise armies, to equip fleets.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt742" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt742_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">9</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1517">The necessity of a national government does not make itself as strongly felt in the direction of the internal affairs of society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1518">Nonetheless, there are certain general interests for which only a general authority can usefully provide.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1519">The Union was left the right to regulate all that relates to the value of money; it was charged with the postal service; it was given the right to open <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>194<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the great avenues of communication that had to unite the various parts of the territory.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt743" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt743_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">10</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1520">The government of the different states was generally considered free in its sphere, but it could abuse this independence and compromise the security of the entire Union through imprudent measures. For these rare cases, defined in advance, the federal government was permitted to intervene in the internal affairs of the states.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt744" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt744_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">11</a> That explains how, while still recognizing in each of the confederated republics the power to modify and change its legislation, each was, nevertheless, forbidden to make retroactive laws and to create bodies of noblemen within its midst.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt745" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt745_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">12</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1521">Finally, since the federal government had to be able to fulfill the obligations imposed on it, it was given the unlimited right to levy taxes.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt746" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt746_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">13</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1522">When you pay attention to the division of powers as the federal constitution has established it; when, on the one hand, you examine the portion of sovereignty that the particular states have reserved to themselves and, on the other, the share of power that the Union took, it is easily discovered that the federal law-makers had formed very clear and very sound ideas about what I earlier called governmental centralization.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt747" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt747_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1523">The United States forms not only a republic, but also a confederation.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt748" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt748_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a> But the national authority there is, in several respects, more centralized than it was in the same period under several of the absolute monarchies of Europe. I will cite only two examples.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>195<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1524">France counted thirteen sovereign courts that, most often, had the right to interpret the law without appeal. It possessed, in addition, certain provinces called <span class="ital">pays d’É</span><span class="sub">tats</span> that could refuse their support, after the sovereign authority, charged with representing the nation, had ordered the raising of a tax.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1525">The Union has only a single court to interpret the law, as well as a single legislature to make the law; a tax voted by the representatives of the nation obligates all the citizens. So the Union is more centralized on these two essential points than the French monarchy was; the Union, however, is only a collection of confederated republics.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1526">In Spain, certain provinces<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt749" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt749_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a> had the power to establish their own customs system, a power that, by its very essence, stems from national sovereignty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1527">In America, Congress alone has the right to regulate commerce among the states. So the government of the confederation is more centralized on this point than that of the kingdom of Spain.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1528">It is true that, in the end, you arrived at the same point, since in France and in Spain the royal power is always able to execute, by force if necessary, what the constitution of the kingdom denied it the right to do. But I am talking here about theory.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1531">In the organization of the powers of the Union, the plan that was traced in advance by the particular constitution of each of the states was followed on many points.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1532">The federal legislative body of the Union was composed of a Senate and a House of Representatives.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1533">The spirit of conciliation caused different rules to be followed in the formation of each of these assemblies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1534">I brought out above that, when the Americans wanted to establish the federal constitution, two opposing interests found themselves face to face. These two interests had given birth to two opinions.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1535">Some wanted to make the Union a league of independent states, a sort of congress where the representatives of distinct peoples would come to discuss certain points of common interest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1536">Others wanted to unite all the inhabitants of the old colonies into one and the same people, and give them a government that, although its sphere would be limited, would be able to act within this sphere, as the one and only representative of the nation. The practical consequences of these two theories were very different.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1537">Thus, if it was a matter of organizing a league and not a national government, it was up to the majority of the states to make laws, and not up <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>197<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to the majority of the inhabitants of the Union. For each state, large or small, would then conserve its character of independent power and would enter into the Union on a perfectly equal footing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1538">On the contrary, from the moment when the inhabitants of the United States were considered to form one and the same people, it was natural that only the majority of the citizens of the Union made the law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1539">Understandably, the small states could not consent to the application of this doctrine without completely abdicating their existence in what concerned federal sovereignty; for, from co-regulating power, they would become an insignificant fraction of a great people. The first system would have granted them an unreasonable power; the second nullified them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1540">In this situation, what almost always happens when interests are opposed to arguments happened: the rules of logic were made to bend. The law-makers adopted a middle course that forced conciliation of two systems theoretically irreconcilable.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1541">The principle of the independence of the states triumphed in the formation of the Senate;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt751" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt751_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a> the dogma of national sovereignty, in the composition of the House of Representatives.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt752" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt752_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1542">Each state had to send two senators to Congress and a certain number of representatives,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt753" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt753_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a> in proportion to its population.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt754" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt754_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">14</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1543">Today, as a result of this arrangement, the state of New York has forty representatives in Congress and only two senators; the state of Delaware, two senators and only one representative. So in the Senate, the state of Delaware is the equal of the state of New York, while the latter has, in the House of Representatives, forty times more influence than the first. Thus, it can happen that the minority of the nation, dominating the Senate, entirely paralyzes the desires of the majority, represented by the other chamber; this is contrary to the spirit of constitutional governments.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1544">All this shows clearly how rare and difficult it is to link all the parts of legislation together in a logical and rational manner.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1545">In the long run, time always gives birth to different interests and consecrates diverse rights in the same people. Then, when it is a question of establishing a general constitution, each of these interests and rights serves as so many natural obstacles that are opposed to following all of the consequences of any one political principle. So only at the birth of societies can you be perfectly logical in the laws. When you see a people enjoy this advantage, do not rush to conclude that they are wise; instead, think that they are young.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>199<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1546">At the time when the federal Constitution was formed, only two interests positively opposed to each other existed among the Anglo-Americans: the interest of individuality for the particular states, and the interest of union for the whole people. It was necessary to come to a compromise.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1547">You must recognize, nonetheless, that up to now this part of the Constitution has not produced the evils that could be feared.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1548">All the states are young;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt755" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt755_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a> they are near each other; they have homogeneous mores, ideas and needs; the difference that results from their greater or lesser size is not sufficient to give them strongly opposed interests. So the small states have never been seen to join together in the Senate against the plans of the large. There is, moreover, such an irresistible force in the legal expression of the will of an entire people that, when the majority expresses itself in the organ of the House of Representatives, the Senate, facing it, finds itself quite weak.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1549">Beyond that, it must not be forgotten that it did not depend on the American law-makers to make one and the same nation out of the people to whom they wanted to give laws. The aim of the federal Constitution was not to destroy the existence of the states, but only to restrain it. So, from the moment when a real power was left to those secondary bodies (and it could not be taken from them), the habitual use of constraint to bend them to the will of the majority was renounced in advance. This said, the introduction of the individual strengths of the states into the mechanism of the federal government was nothing extraordinary. It only took note of an existing fact, a recognized power that had to be treated gently and not violated.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1557">The American law-makers had a difficult task to fulfill: they wanted to create an executive power that depended on the majority and yet was strong enough by itself to act freely in its sphere.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt759" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt759_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1558">The maintenance of the republican form required that the representative of the executive power be subject to the national will.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1559">The President is an elective magistrate. His honor, goods, liberty, life answer continually to the people for the good use that he will make of his power. While exercising his power, moreover, he is not completely independent. The Senate watches over him in his relations with foreign powers, as well as in the distribution of positions; so he can be neither corrupted nor corrupt.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1560">The law-makers of the Union recognized that the executive power could not fulfill its task usefully and with dignity, if they did not succeed in giving it more stability and strength than it had been granted in the particular states.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>202<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1561">The President was named for four years and could be re-elected. With a future, he had the courage to work for the public good and the means to implement it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1562">The President was made the one and only representative of the executive power of the Union. Care was even taken not to subordinate his will to those of a council: a dangerous measure that, while weakening the action of the government, lessens the accountability of those who govern. The Senate has the right to strike down some of the acts of the President, but it can neither force him to act, nor share the executive power with him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1563">The action of the legislature on the executive power can be direct; we have just seen that the Americans took care that it was not. It can also be indirect.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1564">The chambers, by depriving the public official of his salary, take away a part of his independence; it must be feared that, masters of making laws, they will little by little take away the portion of power that the Constitution wanted to keep for him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1565">This dependence of the executive power is one of the vices inherent in republican constitutions. The Americans have not been able to destroy the inclination that leads legislative assemblies to take hold of government,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt760" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt760_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a> but they have made this inclination less irresistible.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>203<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1566">The salary of the President is fixed, at his entry into office, for the entire time that his leadership lasts. In addition, the President is armed with a qualified veto that permits him to stop the passage of laws that would be able to destroy the portion of independence that the constitution left to him. There can only be an unequal struggle, however, between the President and the legislature, since the latter, by persevering in its intentions, always has the power to overcome the resistance that opposes it. But the qualified veto at least forces it to retrace its steps; it forces the legislature to consider the question again; and this time, it can no longer decide except with a two-thirds majority of those voting. The veto, moreover, is a kind of appeal to the people; the executive power pleads its cause and makes its reasons heard. Without this guarantee, it could be oppressed in secret. But if the legislature perseveres in its intentions, can it not always overcome the resistance that opposes it? To that I will answer that in the constitution of all peoples, no matter what its nature, there is a point where the law-maker is obliged to rely on the good sense and virtue of the citizens. This point is closer and more visible in republics, more removed and more carefully hidden in monarchies; but it is always found somewhere. There is no country where the law can foresee everything and where the institutions must take the place of reason and mores.</p>

<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1567"><span class="ital">The executive power, in the United States, limited and exceptional, like the sovereignty in the name of which it acts.—The executive power in France extends to everything, like the sovereignty there.—The King is one of the authors of the law.—The President is only the executor of the law.—Other differences that arise from the duration of the two powers.—The President hampered in the sphere of executive power.—The King is free there.—France, despite these differences, resembles a republic more than the Union does a monarchy.—Comparison of the number of officials who depend on the executive power in the two countries.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1568">The executive power plays such a great role in the destiny of nations that I want to stop for an instant here in order to explain better what place it occupies among the Americans.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1569">In order to conceive a clear and precise idea of the position of the President of the United States, it is useful to compare it to that of the King in one of the constitutional monarchies of Europe.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt761" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt761_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>205<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1570">In this comparison, I will attach little importance to the external signs of power; they fool the observer more than they help.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1571">When a monarchy is gradually transformed into a republic, the executive power there keeps titles, honors, respect, and even money, long after it has lost the reality of power. The English, after having cut off the head of one of their kings and having chased another from the throne, still knelt to speak to the successors of these princes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1572">On the other hand, when republics fall under the yoke of one man, power continues to appear simple, plain and modest in its manners, as if it had not already risen above everyone. When the emperors despotically disposed of the fortune and the life of their citizens, they were still called Caesar when spoken to, and they went informally to have supper at the homes of their friends.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1573">So we must abandon the surface and penetrate deeper.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1574">Sovereignty, in the United States, is divided between the Union and the states; while among us, it is one and compact. From that arises the first and greatest difference that I notice between the President of the United States and the King in France.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1575">In the United States, executive power is limited and exceptional,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt762" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt762_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a> like <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>206<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the very sovereignty in whose name it acts; in France, it extends to everything, like the sovereignty there.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1576">The Americans have a federal government; we have a national government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1577">This is a primary cause of inferiority that results from the very nature of things; but it is not the only one. The second in importance is this: strictly speaking, sovereignty can be defined as the right to make laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1578">The King, in France, really constitutes one part of the sovereign power, since laws do not exist if he refuses to sanction them. In addition, he executes the law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1579">The President also executes the law, but he does not really take part in making the law, since, by refusing his consent, he cannot prevent it from existing. So he is not part of the sovereign power; he is only its agent.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1580">Not only does the King, in France, constitute one portion of the sovereign power, but he also participates in the formation of the legislature, which is the other portion. He participates by naming the members of one chamber and by ending at his will the term of the mandate of the other. The President of the United States takes no part in the composition of the legislative body and cannot dissolve it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1581">The King shares with the Chambers the right to propose laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1582">The President has no similar initiative.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1583">The King is represented, within the Chambers, by a certain number of agents who set forth his views, uphold his opinions and make his maxims of government prevail.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1584">The President has no entry into Congress; his ministers are excluded as he is, and it is only by indirect pathways that he makes his influence and his opinion penetrate this great body.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>207<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1585">So the King of France operates as an equal with the legislature, which cannot act without him, as he cannot act without it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1586">The President is placed beside the legislature, as an inferior and dependent power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1587">In the exercise of executive power strictly speaking, the point on which his position seems closest to that of the King in France, the President still remains inferior due to several very great causes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1588">First, the power of the King in France has the advantage of duration over that of the President. Now, duration is one of the first elements of strength. Only what must exist for a long time is loved and feared.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1589">The President of the United States is a magistrate elected for four years. The King in France is a hereditary leader.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1590">In the exercise of executive power, the President of the United States is constantly subject to jealous oversight. He prepares treaties, but he does not make them; he designates people for offices, but he does not appoint them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt763" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt763_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">17</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1591">The King of France is the absolute master in the sphere of executive power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1592">The President of the United States is accountable for his actions. French law says that the person of the King of France is inviolable.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1593">But above the one as above the other stands a ruling power, that of public opinion. This power is less defined in France than in the United States; less recognized, less formulated in the laws; but, in fact, it exists there. In America, it proceeds by elections and by decisions; in France, by revolutions. Hence France and the United States, despite the diversity of their constitutions, have this point in common: public opinion is, in effect, the dominant power.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt764" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt764_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> So the generative principle of the laws is, in actual fact, the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>208<span class="bracket">]</span></span> same among the two peoples, although its developments are more or less free, and the consequences that are drawn from it are often different. This principle, by its nature, is essentially republican. Consequently, I think that France, with its King, resembles a republic more than the Union, with its President, resembles a monarchy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1594">In all that precedes, I have been careful to point out only the main points of difference. If I had wanted to get into details, the picture would have been still more striking. But I have too much to say not to want to be brief.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1595">I remarked that the power of the President of the United States, in his sphere, exercises only a limited sovereignty, while that of the King, in France, acts within the circle of a complete sovereignty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1596">I could have shown the governmental power of the King in France surpassing even its natural limits, however extensive they were, and penetrating into the administration of individual interests in a thousand ways.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1597">To this cause of influence, I could join that which results from the great number of public officials, nearly all of whom owe their mandate to the executive power. This number has surpassed all known limits among us; it reaches 138,000.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt765" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt765_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">18</a> Each of these 138,000 nominations must be considered as an element of strength. The President does not have an absolute right to appoint to public positions, and those positions hardly exceed 12,000.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt766" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt766_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">19</a></p>

</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1599">If the executive power is less strong in America than in France, the cause must be attributed to circumstances perhaps more than to laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1600">It is principally in its relations with foreigners that the executive power of a nation finds the opportunity to deploy skill and force.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1601">If the life of the Union were constantly threatened, if its great interests were found involved daily in those of other powerful peoples, you would see the executive power grow in opinion by what would be expected of it and by what it would execute.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1602">The President of the United States is, it is true, the head of the army, but this army is composed of 6,000 soldiers;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt767" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt767_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> he commands the fleet, but the fleet numbers only a few vessels; he directs the foreign affairs of the Union, but the United States has no neighbors. Separated from the rest of the world by the ocean, still too weak to want to dominate the sea, they have no enemies; and their interests are only rarely in contact with those of the other nations of the globe.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1603">This demonstrates well that the practice of government must not be judged by theory.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1604">The President of the United States possesses some nearly royal prerogatives that he does not have the opportunity to use; and the rights that, up to now, he is able to use are very circumscribed. The laws allow him to be strong; circumstances keep him weak.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1605">On the contrary, circumstances, still more than the laws, give royal authority in France its greatest strength.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>210<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1606">In France, the executive power struggles constantly against immense obstacles and disposes of immense resources to overcome them. It increases with the greatness of the things that it executes and with the importance of the events that it directs, without thereby modifying its constitution.</p>

<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_067">Why the President of the United States, to Lead Public Affairs, Does Not Need to Have a Majority in the Chambers</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1608">It is an established axiom in Europe that a constitutional King cannot govern when the opinion of the legislative chambers is not in agreement with his.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1609">Several Presidents of the United States have been seen to lose the support of the majority of the legislative body, without having to leave power, nor without causing any great harm to society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1610">I have heard this fact cited to prove the independence and strength of the executive power in America. A few moments of reflection are sufficient, on the contrary, to see there the proof of its weakness.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1611">A European King needs to obtain the support of the legislative body to fulfill the task that the constitution imposes on him, because this task is immense. A European constitutional King is not only the executor of the law; the care of its execution so completely devolves onto him that, if the law is against him, he would be able to paralyze its force. He needs the chambers to make the law; the chambers need him to execute it; they are two powers that cannot live without each other; the gears of government stop at the moment when there is discord between them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1612">In America, the President cannot stop the making of laws; he cannot escape the obligation to execute them. His zealous and sincere support is undoubtedly useful, but it is not necessary to the course of government. In everything essential that he does, he is directly or indirectly subject to the legislature; where he is entirely independent of it, he can hardly do anything. So it is his weakness, and not his strength, that allows him to live in opposition to the legislative power.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>211<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1613">In Europe, there must be agreement between the King and the Chambers, because there can be a serious struggle between them. In America, agreement is not required, because the struggle is impossible.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1615">The system of election, applied to the head of the executive power among a great people, presents some dangers that experience and historians have sufficiently pointed out.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1616">Consequently, I do not want to talk about it except in relation to America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1617">The dangers feared from the system of election are more or less great, depending on the place that the executive power occupies and its importance in the State, depending on the method of election and the circumstances in which the people who elect are found.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1618">Not without reason, the elective system, applied to the head of State, is criticized for offering such a great lure to individual ambitions and inflaming them so strongly in the pursuit of power that often, when legal means are no longer sufficient, they appeal to force when right happens to desert them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1619">It is clear that the greater the prerogatives of the executive power, the greater the lure; also, the more the ambition of the pretenders is excited, the more it finds support among a host of men of lesser ambition who hope to share power after their candidate has triumphed.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt768" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt768_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1620">The dangers of the elective system increase therefore in direct proportion to the influence exercised by the executive power in the affairs of the State.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1621">The Polish revolutions should not be attributed only to the elective system in general, but to the fact that the elected magistrate was the head of a large monarchy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt769" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt769_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1622">So before discussing the absolute goodness of the elective system, there is always an intervening question to resolve, that of knowing if the geographic position, laws, habits, mores and opinions of the people among whom you want to introduce it allow you to establish a weak and dependent executive power. To want the representative of the State to be simultaneously armed with great power and elected is, to my mind, to express two contradictory desires. For my part, I know only one way to make hereditary royalty change to a state of elected power. Its sphere of action must be contracted in advance; its prerogatives gradually reduced; and little by little, the people accustomed to living without its aid. But the republicans of Europe are hardly concerned with this. Since many among them hate tyranny only because they are the objects of its rigors, the extent of executive power does not offend them; they attack only its origin, without noticing the tight bond that links these two things.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1623">No one has yet been found who cared about risking his honor and his life to become President of the United States, because the President has only a temporary, limited and dependent power. Fortune must put an immense prize at stake in order for desperate players to enter the lists. [≠For my part, I would prefer to be <span class="ital">Premier Ministre</span> in France than President of the Union.≠] No candidate, until now, has been able to raise ardent sympathies and dangerous popular passions in his favor.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt770" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt770_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> The reason is simple. Once at the head of the government,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt771" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt771_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a> he can distribute to his friends neither <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>213<span class="bracket">]</span></span> much power, nor much wealth, nor much glory; and his influence in the State<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt772" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt772_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a> is too weak for factions to see their success or their ruin in his elevation to power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1624">Hereditary monarchies have a great advantage. Since the particular interest of a family is continually tied in a close way to the interest of the State, there is never a single moment when the latter is left abandoned to itself. I do not know if in these monarchies public affairs are better conducted than elsewhere; but at least there is always someone who takes charge for good or ill, depending on his capacity.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt773" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt773_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1625">In elective States, on the contrary, at the approach of the election and a long time before it happens, the gears of government no longer function, in a way, except by themselves. The laws can undoubtedly be put together so that the election takes place at one go and rapidly, and the seat of executive power never remains vacant so to speak; but no matter what is done, an empty place exists mentally despite the efforts of the law-maker.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1626">At the approach of the election, the head of the executive power thinks only of the struggle to come; he no longer has a future; he can undertake nothing, and pursues only languidly what someone else perhaps is going to achieve. “I am so near the moment of my retirement,” wrote President Jefferson on 21 [28 (ed.)] January 1809 (six weeks before the election), “that I no longer take part in public affairs except by expressing my opinion. To me, it seems just to leave to my successor the initiation of measures that he will have to execute and for which he will have to bear responsibility.”</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1627">On its side, the nation has its eyes focused only on a single point; it is occupied only with overseeing the birth about to take place.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>214<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1628">The more vast the place occupied by the executive power in the leadership of public affairs, the greater and more necessary is its habitual action, and the more dangerous such a state of things is. Among a people who have contracted the habit of being governed by the executive power, and with even more reason, of being administered by it, election cannot help but produce a profound disturbance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1629">In the United States, the action of the executive power can slow down with impunity, because this action is weak and circumscribed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1630">When the head of government is elected, a lack of stability in the internal and external policies of the State almost always follows. That is one of the principal vices of this system.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1631">But this vice is felt more or less, depending on the portion of power granted to the elected magistrate. In Rome, the principles of government never varied, although the consuls were changed annually, because the Senate was the directing power; and the Senate was an hereditary body. In most of the monarchies of Europe, if the King were elected, the kingdom would change faces with each new choice.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1632">In America, the President exercises a fairly great influence on affairs of State, but he does not conduct them; the preponderant power resides in the whole national representation. Therefore, the mass of people must be changed, and not only the President, in order for the maxims of policy to change. Consequently, in America, the system of election, applied to the head of the executive power, does not harm the steadiness of government in a very tangible way.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1633">The lack of steadiness is an evil so inherent in the elective system, moreover, that it still makes itself keenly felt in the President’s sphere of action, no matter how circumscribed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1634">Mr. Quincy Adams, when he took power, dismissed most of those appointed by his predecessor; and of all the removable officials that the federal administration uses, I do not know of a single one who was left in office by General Jackson in the first year that followed the election.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt774" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt774_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>215<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1635">The Americans thought correctly that the head of the executive power, in order to fulfill his mission and bear the weight of full responsibility, had to remain free, as much as possible, to choose his agents himself and to remove them at will;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt775" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt775_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a> the legislative body watches over rather than directs <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>216<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the President. From that it follows that at each new election, the fate of all federal employees is as if in suspense.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>217<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1636">In the constitutional monarchies of Europe, the complaint is that the destiny of the obscure agents of the administration often depends on the fate of the ministers. It is even worse in States where the head of government is elected. The reason for this is simple. In constitutional monarchies, ministers replace each other rapidly; but the principal representative of the executive power never changes, which contains the spirit of innovation within certain limits. So administrative systems there vary in the details rather than in the principles; one cannot be suddenly substituted for another without causing a kind of revolution. In America, this revolution takes place every four years in the name of law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1637">As for the individual misfortunes that are the natural consequence of such legislation, it must be admitted that the lack of stability in the lot of officials does not produce in America the evils that would be expected elsewhere. In the United States, it is so easy to make an independent living that to remove an official from an office that he holds sometimes means taking away the comforts of life, but never the means to sustain it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1638">I said at the beginning of this chapter that the dangers of the mode of election, applied to the head of the executive power, were more or less great, depending on the circumstances in which the people who elect are found.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1639">Efforts to reduce the role of the executive power are made in vain. There is something over which this power exercises a great influence, whatever the place that the laws have given it. That is foreign policy; a negotiation can hardly be started and successfully carried through except by a single man. [{Physical force can only be adequately put in motion [v: directed] by a single will.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1640">The more precarious and perilous the position of a people, the more the need for consistency and stability makes itself felt in the direction of foreign <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>218<span class="bracket">]</span></span> affairs, and the more dangerous the system of election of the head of State becomes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1641">The policy of the Americans in relation to the whole world is simple; you would almost be able to say that no one needs them, and that they need no one. Their independence is never threatened.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1642">So among them, the role of executive power is as limited by circumstances as by laws. The President can frequently change his views without having the State suffer or perish.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1643">Whatever the prerogatives with which the executive power is vested, the time that immediately precedes the election and the time while it is taking place can always be considered as a period of national crisis.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1644">The more the internal situation of a country is troubled and the greater its external perils, the more dangerous this moment of crisis is for it. Among the peoples of Europe, there are very few who would not have to fear conquest or anarchy every time that they chose a new leader.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1645">In America, society is so constituted that it can maintain itself on its own and without help; external dangers are never pressing. The election of the President is a cause for agitation, not for ruin.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1648">When a people gather in arms in the public square to choose a leader, it exposes itself not only to the dangers presented by the elective system itself, but also to all those of civil war which arise from such a method of election.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1649">When Polish laws made the choice of the king depend on the <span class="ital">veto</span> of a single man, they invited the murder of this man or created anarchy in advance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1650">As you study the institutions of the United States and look more attentively at the political and social situation of this country, you notice a marvelous accord there between fortune and human efforts. America was a new country; but the people who lived there had already long made use of liberty elsewhere: two great causes of internal order. Furthermore, America had no fear of conquest. The American law-makers, taking advantage of these favorable circumstances, had no difficulty in establishing a weak and dependent executive power; having created it so, they could make it elective without risk.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1651">Nothing remained for them to do except to choose, from among the different systems of election, the least dangerous; the rules that they drew up in this respect completed admirably the guarantees that the physical and political constitution of the country already provided.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1652">The problem to solve was to find a mode of election that, while still expressing the real will of the people, little excited their passions and kept the people in the least possible suspense. First, they granted that a <span class="ital">simple</span> majority would make the law. But it was still very difficult to obtain this majority without having to fear delays that they wanted to avoid above all.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1653">It is rare, in fact, to see a man get the majority of votes on the first try from among a large population. The difficulty increases still more in a republic of confederated states where local influences are much more developed and more powerful.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1654">A way to obviate this second obstacle presented itself: to delegate the electoral powers of the nation to a body that represented it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1655">This mode of election made a majority more probable; for the fewer the electors, the easier it is for them to agree among themselves. It also presented more guarantees for a good choice.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1656">But should the right to elect be entrusted to the legislative body itself, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>220<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the usual representative of the nation; or, on the contrary, must an electoral college be formed whose sole purpose would be to proceed to the naming of the President?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt777" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt777_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1657">The Americans preferred this last option. They thought that the men sent to make ordinary laws would only incompletely represent the wishes of the people relating to the election of the first magistrate. Being elected, moreover, for more than a year, they could represent a will that had already changed. They judged that, if the legislature was charged with electing the head of the executive power, its members would become, long before the election, the objects of corrupting maneuvers and the playthings of intrigue; while special electors, like jurors, would remain unknown in the crowd until the day when they must act and would only appear at one moment to deliver their decision.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1658">So they established that each state would name a certain number of electors,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt778" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt778_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">20</a> who would in turn elect the President. And, since they had noticed that assemblies charged with choosing heads of government in elective countries inevitably became centers of passions and intrigue, that sometimes they took hold of powers that did not belong to them, and that often their operations, and the uncertainties that followed, lasted long enough to put the State in danger, they decided that the electors would all vote on a set day, but without meeting together.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt779" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt779_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">21</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1659">The mode of election in two stages made a majority probable, but did not guarantee it, for it could be that the electors would differ among themselves as those who named them would have differed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1660">In this case, the Americans were led necessarily to take one of three measures: it was necessary to have new electors named, or to consult once again those already named, or finally to refer the choice to a new authority.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>221<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1661">The first two methods, apart from the fact that they were not very certain, led to delays and perpetuated an always dangerous excitement.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1662">So they settled on the third and agreed that the votes of the electors would be transmitted in secret to the president of the Senate. He would count the votes on the day fixed and in the presence of the two houses. If no candidate had gained a majority, the House of Representatives would itself proceed immediately to the election; but they took care to limit its right. The Representatives could only elect one of the three candidates who had obtained the largest number of votes.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt780" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt780_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">22</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1663">As you see, only in a rare case, difficult to foresee in advance, is the election left to the ordinary representatives of the nation; and even then, they can only choose a citizen already designated by a strong minority of the special electors; a happy combination, that reconciles the respect owed to the will of the people with the rapidity of execution and the guarantees of order required by the interest of the State. Yet, by making the House of Representatives decide the question, in case of division, the complete solution of all difficulties had still not been achieved; for the majority in the House of Representatives could in turn be doubtful, and this time the Constitution offered no remedy. But by establishing required candidates, by restricting their number to three, by relying on the choices of some enlightened men, it had smoothed all the obstacles<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt781" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt781_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">23</a> over which it could have some power; the others were inherent in the elective system itself.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt782" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt782_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1664">During the forty-five years the federal Constitution has existed, the United States has already elected its President twelve times.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1665">Ten elections were done immediately, by the simultaneous vote of the special electors seated at different points of the territory.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1666">The House of Representatives has used the exceptional right with which it is vested in case of division only twice. The first, in 1801, was at the time of the election of Jefferson; and the second, in 1825, when Quincy Adams was named.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1668">I have talked about the favorable circumstances in which the United States was found for adopting the elective system, and I have shown the precautions taken by the law-makers to reduce its dangers. The Americans are used to having all kinds of elections. Experience has taught them what level of agitation they can reach and where they must stop. The vast extent of their territory and the distribution of the inhabitants make a collision <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>223<span class="bracket">]</span></span> among the different parties less probable and less perilous than anywhere else. Until now, the political circumstances in which the nation has found itself during elections have not presented any real danger. [&lt;Finally, the power of the President is so dependent and so limited that the passions of the candidates and those of their partisans can never be either very ardent or very long-lasting.&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1669">But the moment of the election of the President of the United States can still be considered a period of national crisis.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1670">The influence that the President exercises on the course of public affairs is undoubtedly weak and indirect, but it extends over the entire nation; the choice of President has only a moderate importance for each citizen, but it matters to all citizens. Now, an interest, however small, assumes a character of great importance from the moment it becomes a general interest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1671">Compared to a king of Europe, the President has certainly few means to create partisans for himself; nonetheless, the places he has at his disposal are numerous enough<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt783" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt783_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a> for several thousands of the voters to be either directly or indirectly interested in his cause.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1672">In the United States as elsewhere, moreover, parties feel the need to gather around a man, in order to be more easily understood by the crowd. So they generally use the name of the candidate for President as a symbol; in him, they personify their theories. Thus, parties have a great interest in determining the election in their favor, not so much for making their doctrines triumph with the help of the elected President, as for showing, by his election, that these doctrines have won the majority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1673">Long before the fixed moment arrives, the election becomes the greatest and, so to speak, the sole matter that preoccupies minds. Factions redouble their ardor [the administration finds itself attacked from all directions; {slanders, insults, rantings of all types are thrown lavishly against it}]; all the artificial passions that can be imagined, in a happy and tranquil country, are stirred up at this moment in full view.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>224<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1674">On his side, the President is absorbed by the care to defend himself. He no longer governs in the interest of the State, but in that of his re-election; he grovels before the majority; and often, instead of resisting its passions, as his duty requires, he runs ahead of its caprices.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1675">As the election approaches, intrigues become more active; agitation, more intense and more widespread. The citizens divide into several camps, each taking the name of its candidate. The entire nation falls into a feverish state; the election is then the daily story of the public papers, the subject of individual conversations, the goal of all moves, the object of all thoughts, the sole interest of the moment. [≠The danger certainly is more apparent than real.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1676">It is true that as soon as fortune has decided, this ardor dissipates; everything becomes calm, and the river, once overflowing, retreats peacefully to its bed. But shouldn’t we be astonished that the storm could arise? [&lt;For the choice that so strongly preoccupied the nation can influence its prosperity and its dreams only in a very indirect way; the passions that arose did not find their source in those real interests and penchants [doubtful reading (ed.)] that so profoundly trouble the human heart [v: society] [v: stirring the deepest levels of the human heart and turning society upside down to be satisfied]. For the election of the President of the United States cannot put into play any of those dangerous human passions that find their source in profound beliefs or in great positive interests.&gt;]</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1679">To prevent the head of the executive power from being re-elected seems, at first glance, contrary to reason.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt785" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt785_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a> We know what influence the talents or character of one man exercise over the destiny of an entire people, especially in difficult circumstances and in times of crisis.

<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>226<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1681">Intrigue and corruption are the natural vices of elective governments. But when the head of the State can be re-elected, these vices spread indefinitely and compromise the very existence of the country. When an ordinary candidate wants to succeed by intrigue, his maneuvers can only be <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>227<span class="bracket">]</span></span> extended over a circumscribed space. When, on the contrary, the head of the State himself gets into the fray, he borrows for his own use the strength of the government.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt788" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt788_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1682">In the first case, it is one man with his limited means; in the second, it is the State itself with its immense resources that schemes and corrupts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1683">The ordinary citizen who uses reprehensible maneuverings to gain power can harm public prosperity only in an indirect manner; but if the representative of the executive power enters the lists, concern for the government becomes, for him, something of secondary interest; the main interest is his election. Negotiations, like laws, are, for him, nothing more than electoral schemes; positions become recompense for services rendered, not to the nation, but to its leader. Even if the action of the government would not always be contrary to the interest of the country, it would at least no longer serve it. Yet the action of the government is undertaken for its use alone.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1684">It is impossible to consider the ordinary course of affairs in the United States, without noticing that the desire to be re-elected dominates the thoughts of the President; that the entire policy of his administration leads to this point; that his smallest steps are subordinated to this end; that above all, as the moment of crisis approaches, individual interest replaces general interest in his mind.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1685">So the principle of re-election makes the corrupting influence of elective government more widespread and more dangerous. It tends to degrade the political morality of the people and to replace patriotism with cleverness.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1686">In America, it attacks the sources of national existence even more fundamentally.</p>

But every law whose effect is to develop this seed of death cannot miss becoming fatal in the long run, even if its bad effects do not immediately make themselves felt.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1688">The principle of ruin in absolute monarchies is the unlimited and unreasonable expansion of royal power. A measure that removes the counterweight that the constitution left to this power would therefore be radically bad, even if its effects seemed unnoticeable for a long time.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1689">In the same way, in countries where democracy governs and where the people constantly draw everything to themselves, laws which make their action more and more immediate and irresistible attack, in a direct way, the existence of the government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1690">The greatest merit of the American law-makers is to have seen this truth clearly and to have had the courage to put it into practice. [{The greatest glory of this people is to have known how to appreciate it and to submit themselves to it.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1691">They understood that beyond the people there needed to be a certain number of powers that, without being completely independent of the people, nonetheless enjoyed in their sphere a fairly large degree of liberty; so, though forced to obey the permanent direction of the majority, they could nevertheless struggle against its caprices and refuse its dangerous demands.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1692">To this effect, they concentrated all the executive power of the nation in one pair of hands; they gave the President extensive prerogatives, and armed him with a veto, to resist the encroachments of the legislature.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt790" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt790_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1693">But by introducing the principle of re-election, they have partially destroyed their work. They have granted great power to the President, and have taken from him the will to use it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1694">Not re-eligible, the President was not independent of the people, for he did not cease being responsible to them; but the favor of the people was not so necessary to him that he had to bend in all cases to their will.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1695">Re-eligible (and this is true above all in our time when political morality is becoming lax and when men of great character are disappearing), the President of the United States is only a docile instrument in the hands of the majority. He loves what it loves, hates what it hates; he flies ahead of its will, anticipates its complaints, bends before its slightest desires. The law-makers wanted him to lead the majority, and he follows it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1696">Thus, in order not to deprive the State of the talents of one man, they have rendered his talents almost useless; and to arrange for a resource in extraordinary circumstances, they have exposed the country to daily dangers.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt791" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt791_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a></p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1698">I have examined the legislative power and the executive power of the Union. It still remains for me to consider the judicial power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1699">Here I must reveal my fears to readers.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1700">The judicial institutions exercise a great influence on the destiny of the Anglo-Americans; they hold a very important place among political institutions properly so called. From this point of view, they particularly merit our attention.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1701">But how to make the political action of the American courts understood, without entering into some of the technical details of their constitution and of their forms; and how to get into the details without discouraging, by the natural dryness of such a subject, the curiosity of the reader? How to remain clear and still be concise?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1702">[&lt;So I have said only what I believed indispensable for someone to judge the political action of courts within the confederation.&gt; So often, I have assumed the reader’s pre-existent ideas on the administration of justice among the people of the English race; even more often I counted on him searching in the sources that I point out in order to fill out my ideas. In a word, I have said only what I believed indispensable for someone to be able to understand the political action of the federal courts.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1703">I do not flatter myself that I have escaped these different dangers. Men of the world will still find that I go on too long; legal specialists will think that I am too brief. But that is a disadvantage connected to my subject in general and to the special matter that I am treating at this moment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1704">The greatest difficulty was not to know how the federal government would be constituted, but how obedience to its laws would be assured.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1705">Governments generally have only two means to overcome the efforts of the governed to resist them: the physical force that they find within themselves; the moral force that the decisions of the courts bestow on them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1706">A government that would have only war to enforce obedience to its laws would be very close to its ruin. One of two things would probably happen to it. If it were weak and moderate, it would use force only at the last extremity <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>231<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and would let a host of incidents of partial disobedience go by unnoticed; then the State would fall little by little into anarchy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1707">If it were audacious and powerful, it would resort daily to the use of violence, and soon you would see it degenerate into pure military despotism. Its inaction and its action would be equally harmful to the governed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1708">The great object of justice is to substitute the idea of law for that of violence; to place intermediaries between the government and the use of physical force.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1709">The power of opinion generally granted by men to the intervention of the courts is something surprising. This power is so great that it is still attached to judicial form when the substance no longer exists; it gives flesh to the shadow.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1710">The moral force with which the courts are vested renders the use of physical force infinitely rarer, substituting for it in most cases; and when, finally, physical force must be exerted, its power is doubled by the moral force that is joined with it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1711">A federal government, more than another government, must desire to obtain the support of the judicial system, because it is weaker by its nature; and efforts at resistance can more easily be organized against it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt793" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt793_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">25</a> If it always and immediately had to resort to the use of force, it would not be adequate to its task.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt794" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt794_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>232<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1712">To make citizens obey its laws, or to repel the aggressions that would be directed against it, the Union therefore had a particular need for courts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1713">But what courts could it use? Each state already had a judicial power organized within it. Would it be necessary to resort to these courts? Would it be necessary to create a federal judicial system? It is easy to prove that the Union could not adapt to its use the judicial power established in the states.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1714">It is undoubtedly important to the security of each person and to the liberty of all that the judicial power should be separated from all the others; but it is no less necessary to national existence that the different powers of the State have the same origin, follow the same principles and act in the same sphere, in a word, that they are <span class="ital">correlative</span> and <span class="ital">homogeneous.</span> No one, I imagine, has ever thought to have crimes committed in France judged by foreign courts in order to be more certain of the impartiality of the magistrates.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1715">The Americans form only a single people, in relation to their federal government. But in the midst of this people, political bodies, dependent on the national government on certain points and independent on all the others, have been allowed to continue to exist; they have their particular origins, their own doctrines and their special means of action. To entrust the enforcement of the laws of the Union to courts instituted by these political bodies, was to deliver the nation to foreign judges.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>233<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1716">Even more, each state is not only a foreigner in relation to the Union, but it is also a daily adversary, since the sovereignty of the Union can only be lost to the profit of that of the states.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1717">So by having the laws of the Union applied by the courts of the individual states, the nation would be delivered, not only to foreign judges, but also to partial judges.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1718">It was not their character alone, moreover, that made the state courts incapable of serving a national end; it was above all their number.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1719">At the moment when the federal Constitution was formed, there were already in the United States thirteen supreme courts of justice from which there was no appeal. Today they number twenty-four. How to accept that a State can endure when its fundamental laws can be interpreted and applied in twenty-four different ways at once! Such a system is as contrary to reason as to the lessons of experience.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1720">So the law-makers of America agreed to create a federal judicial power, in order to apply the laws of the Union and to decide certain questions of general interest which were carefully defined in advance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1721">All of the judicial power of the Union was concentrated in a single tribunal called the Supreme Court of the United States. But to facilitate the dispatch of affairs, inferior courts were added to assist and were charged with judging with sovereign power cases of little importance or with ruling on more important disputes in the first instance. The members of the Supreme Court were not elected by the people or the legislature; the President of the United States had to choose them with the advice of the Senate.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1722">In order to make them independent of the other powers, they were made irremovable, and it was decided that their salary, once fixed, would be beyond the control of the legislature.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt796" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt796_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">26</a></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1725">A first question arose. The Constitution of the United States set up, face to face, two distinct sovereignties, represented in terms of judicial structure by two different court systems; no matter what care was taken to establish the jurisdiction of each of these two court systems, you could not prevent frequent conflicts between them. Now, in this case, who would have the right to establish jurisdiction?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1726">Among peoples who form only one and the same political society, when a question of jurisdiction arises between two courts, it is usually brought before a third that serves as arbiter.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1727">This is easily done because, among these peoples, questions of judicial jurisdiction do not have any relation to questions of national sovereignty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1728">But above the highest court of an individual state and the highest court of the United States, it was impossible to establish any kind of court that was not either one or the other.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1729">So one of these two courts had to be given the right to judge in its own case and to take or accept cognizance of the matter in dispute. This privilege could not be granted to the various courts of the states; that would have destroyed the sovereignty of the Union in fact, after having established it in law; for interpretation of the Constitution would soon have given back to the individual states the portion of independence that the terms of the Constitution took away from them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1730">By creating a federal court, the desire had been to remove from the courts of the states the right to settle, each in its own way, questions of national interest and, by doing so, to succeed in shaping a uniform body of jurisprudence for the interpretation of the laws of the Union. The goal would not have been reached at all if the courts of the individual states, while abstaining from judging cases considered federal, had been able to judge them by pretending that they were not federal.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1731">The Supreme Court of the United States was therefore vested with the right to decide all questions of jurisdiction.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt800" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt800_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">27</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>236<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1732">That was the most dangerous blow brought against the sovereignty of the states. It thus found itself limited not only by the laws, but also by the interpretation of the laws; by a known limit and by another that was unknown; by a fixed rule and by an arbitrary one. It is true that the Constitution had set precise limits to federal sovereignty; but each time this sovereignty is in competition with that of the states, a federal court must decide.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1733">The dangers, moreover, with which this way of proceeding seemed to menace the sovereignty of the states were not as great in reality as they appeared to be.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1734">We will see further along that, in America, real strength resides more in the provincial governments than in the federal government. Federal judges sense the relative weakness of the power in whose name they act; and they are more likely to abandon a right of jurisdiction in cases where it is granted to them by law, than they are led to claim it illegally.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1736">After having recognized the means to set federal jurisdiction, the law-makers of the Union determined the cases in which that jurisdiction must be exercised.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>237<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1737">They acknowledged that there were certain litigants who could only be judged by the federal courts, no matter what the subject of the proceedings.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1738">They then established that there were certain proceedings that could only be decided by these same courts, no matter what the qualification of the litigants.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1739">So the person and the matter became the two bases of federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1740">Ambassadors represent nations friendly to the Union; everything that involves ambassadors involves in a way the entire Union. When an ambassador is party to a legal proceeding, the proceeding becomes an affair that touches on the welfare of the nation; it is natural that a federal court decides.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1741">The Union itself can be the subject of proceedings; in this case, it would have been contrary to reason as well as to the custom of nations, to bring it for judgment before courts representing a sovereignty other than its own. It is for the federal courts alone to decide.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1742">When two individuals, belonging to two different states, have a legal proceeding, you cannot, without disadvantage, have them judged by the courts of one of the two states. It is safer to choose a court that cannot incite the suspicion of any of the parties, and the court that very naturally presents itself is that of the Union.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1743">When the two litigants are no longer isolated individuals, but states, this reason for equity is joined by a political reason of the first order. Here the status of the litigants gives a national importance to all proceedings; the smallest litigious issue between two states involves the peace of the entire Union.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt801" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt801_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">28</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1744">Often the very nature of the proceedings must serve as a rule of jurisdiction. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>238<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Thus all questions that are related to maritime commerce must be settled by federal courts.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt802" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt802_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">29</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1745">The reason is easy to point out: nearly all these questions get into an estimation of the law of nations. From this perspective, they essentially involve the whole Union in relation to foreigners. Since the sea, moreover, does not fall into one judicial circumscription rather than another, only the national court system can have a claim on legal proceedings that have a maritime origin.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1746">The Constitution has enclosed in a single category nearly all the proceedings that, by their nature, must be under the jurisdiction of the federal courts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1747">In this regard, the rule that it indicates is simple, but it comprises in itself alone a vast system of ideas and a multitude of facts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1748">The federal courts, it says, must judge all proceedings that <span class="ital">arise in the laws of the United States.</span></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1749">Two examples will make the thought of the law-maker perfectly clear.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1750">The Constitution forbids the states the right to make laws on the circulation of money; despite this prohibition, a state makes such a law. Interested parties refuse to obey it, understanding that it is contrary to the Constitution. The matter must be brought before a federal court, because the grounds for the case are drawn from the laws of the United States.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1751">Congress establishes a tariff law. Difficulties arise over the understanding of this law. Again, the matter must be presented before the federal courts, because the cause for the proceeding is in the interpretation of a law of the United States.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1752">This rule is in perfect agreement with the bases adopted for the federal Constitution.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1753">The Union, as constituted in 1789, had, it is true, only a limited sovereignty, but the desire was that, within this circle, the Union formed only one and the same people.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt803" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt803_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">30</a> Within this circle, it is sovereign. This point <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>239<span class="bracket">]</span></span> set forth and accepted, all the rest becomes easy; for if you recognize that the United States, within the limits posed by their Constitution, form only one people, the rights belonging to all peoples must surely be granted to them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1754">Now, since the origin of societies, this point is agreed upon: each people has the right to have all questions relating to the enforcement of its own laws judged by its courts. But you answer: the Union is in the singular position that it forms one people only relative to certain matters; for all others, it is nothing. What is the result? At least for all the laws that relate to these matters, the Union has the rights that would be granted to complete sovereignty. The real point of difficulty is knowing what those matters are. This point settled (and we have seen above, while treating jurisdiction, how it was settled), no question truly speaking remains; for once you have established that a proceeding was federal, that is, came within the portion of sovereignty reserved to the Union by the Constitution, it naturally followed that a federal court alone would decide.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1755">So whenever someone wants to attack the laws of the United States, or invoke them in self-defense, it is the federal courts that must be addressed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1756">Thus, the jurisdiction of the courts of the Union expands or contracts depending on whether the sovereignty of the Union itself expands or contracts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1757">We have seen that the principal aim of the law-makers of 1789 had been to divide sovereignty into two distinct portions. In one, they placed the direction of all the general interests of the Union; in the other, the direction of all the interests particular to some of its parts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1758">Their principal concern was to arm the federal government with enough power for it to be able to defend itself, within its sphere, against the encroachments of the individual states.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1759">As for the latter, the general principal adopted was to leave them free in their sphere. Within that sphere, the central government can neither direct them nor even inspect their conduct.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1760">I have indicated in the chapter on the division of powers that this last principle had not always been respected. There are certain laws that an individual state cannot enact, even though the laws apparently involve only that state.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>240<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1761">When a state of the Union enacts a law of this nature, the citizens who are harmed by the execution of this law can appeal to the federal courts.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt804" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt804_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1762">Thus, the jurisdiction of the federal courts extends not only to all the proceedings that have their source in the laws of the Union, but also to all those that arise in the laws that the individual states have enacted unconstitutionally.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1763">The states are forbidden to promulgate <span class="ital">ex post facto</span> laws in criminal matters; the man who is sentenced by virtue of a law of this type can appeal to the federal judicial system.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1764">The Constitution also forbids the states to make laws that can destroy or alter rights acquired by virtue of a contract (<span class="ital">impairing the obligations</span> [<span class="ital">sic: obligation</span>] <span class="ital">of contracts</span>).<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt805" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt805_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">31</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1765">From the moment when an individual believes that he sees a law of his state that harms a right of this type, he can refuse to obey and appeal to the federal justice system.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt806" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt806_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">32</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>241<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1766">To me, this disposition seems to attack the sovereignty of the state more profoundly than all the rest.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt807" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt807_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1767">The rights granted to the federal government, for ends clearly national, are defined and easy to understand. Those that are indirectly conceded to it by the article that I have just cited are not easily felt, and their limits are not easily traced. There is, in fact, a multitude of political laws that act upon the existence of contracts, and that could therefore furnish grounds for encroachment by the central power.</p>

<div id="lf1593-01_argument_035" class="argument">
<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1768"><span class="ital">Natural weakness of the judicial system in confederations.—Efforts that law-makers must make to place, as much as possible, only isolated individuals and not states before the federal courts.—How the Americans succeeded in doing this.—Direct action of the federal courts on ordinary individuals.—Indirect attack against states that violate the laws of the Union.—The decision of the federal judicial system does not destroy provincial law; it enervates it.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1769">I have made known the rights of the federal courts; it is no less important to know how they are exercised.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1770">The irresistible strength of the judicial system, in countries where sovereignty is not divided, comes from the fact that, in those countries, the courts represent the entire nation in a contest with a single individual who has been struck by a judgment. To the idea of law is joined the idea of the force that supports the law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1771">But in countries where sovereignty is divided, it is not always so. There, the judicial system most often finds itself facing, not an isolated individual, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>242<span class="bracket">]</span></span> but a fraction of the nation. Its moral power and its physical power are diminished as a result.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1772">So in federal States, the judicial system is naturally weaker; and the one subject to trial, stronger.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1773">The law-maker, in confederations, must constantly work to give the courts a position analogous to the one they occupy among peoples who have not divided sovereignty. In other words, his most constant efforts must strive toward having the federal judicial system represent the nation, and having the one subject to trial represent an individual interest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1774">A government, whatever its nature, needs to act on the governed in order to force them to give the government what it is owed; it needs to take action against them in order to defend itself from their attacks.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1775">As for the direct action of the government on the governed, in order to force them to obey the law, the Constitution of the United States saw to it that the federal courts, acting in the name of these laws, never had any dealing except with individuals (and that was its highest achievement). In fact, since it had been declared that the confederation formed only one and the same people within the circle drawn by the Constitution, the government, created by this Constitution and acting within its limits, was, as a result, vested with all the rights of a national government, the principal one being to have its injunctions reach ordinary citizens without an intermediary. So when the Union levied a tax, for example, it did not have to apply to the states to collect it, but to each American citizen, according to his share. In turn, the federal judicial system charged with assuring the enforcement of this law of the Union, had to condemn not the recalcitrant State, but the taxpayer. Like the judicial system of other peoples, it found only an individual facing it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt808" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt808_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1776">Note that here the Union itself has chosen its adversary. It has chosen a weak one; it is entirely natural that he succumbs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1777">But when the Union, instead of attacking, is reduced to defending itself, the difficulty increases. The Constitution recognizes the power of the states <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>243<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to make laws. These laws can violate the rights of the Union. Here, necessarily, the Union finds itself in conflict with the sovereignty of the state that enacted the law. Nothing remains except to chose, from among the means of action, the least dangerous. This means was indicated in advance by the general principles that I stated before.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt809" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt809_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">33</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1778">You see that, in the case that I have just supposed, the Union would have been able to cite the state before a federal court that would have declared the law void; this would have followed the most natural course of ideas. But, in this way, the federal judicial system would have found itself directly facing a state, something it wanted to avoid as much as possible.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1779">The Americans have thought that it was nearly impossible for a new law, in its execution, not to harm some individual interest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1780">It is on this individual interest that the authors of the federal constitution rely to attack a legislative measure about which the Union could complain. To this individual interest, they offer a protection.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1781">A state sells lands to a company; one year later, a new law disposes of the same lands in another way, and thus violates the part of the Constitution which forbids changing rights vested by contract. When the one who bought by virtue of the new law presents himself in order to take possession, the owner, who holds his rights from the former law, brings an action before the courts of the Union and has the title of the new owner voided.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt810" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt810_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">34</a> Therefore, in reality, the federal judicial system is grappling with the sovereignty of the state; but it attacks that sovereignty only indirectly and on an application of detail. It thus strikes the law in its consequences, not in its principle. It does not destroy the law; it enervates it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1782">A final hypothesis remained.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1783">Each state formed a corporation that had a separate existence and separate civil laws; consequently, it could sue or be sued before the courts. A state could, for example, bring suit against another state.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1784">In this case, it was no longer a matter for the Union of attacking a provincial law, but of judging a case in which a state was a participant. It was <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>244<span class="bracket">]</span></span> a case like any other; only the status of the litigants was different. Here the danger noted at the beginning of this chapter still exists. But this time it cannot be avoided; it is inherent in the very essence of federal constitutions that they will always result in creating, in the midst of the nation, individuals powerful enough to make it difficult to use the judicial system against them.</p>

<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_076">Elevated Rank That the Supreme Court Occupies among the Great Powers of the State</h2>
<div class="opener">
<div id="lf1593-01_argument_036" class="argument">
<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1785"><span class="ital">No other people have constituted a judicial power as great as the Americans.—Extent of its attributions.—Its political influence.—The peace and the very existence of the Union depend on the wisdom of seven federal judges.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1786">When, after examining the organization of the Supreme Court in detail, you come to consider all of the attributions that it has been given, you easily discover that never has a more immense judicial power been constituted among any people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1787">The Supreme Court is placed higher than any known court, both by the <span class="ital">nature</span> of its rights and by the <span class="ital">type</span> of those subject to trial.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1788">In all the civilized nations of Europe, the government has always shown a great reluctance to allow the ordinary judicial system to decide questions that involve the government itself. This reluctance is naturally greater when the government is more absolute. As liberty increases, on the contrary, the circle of the attributions of the courts is always going to widen; but not one of the European nations has yet thought that every judicial question, of no matter what origin, could be left to judges of ordinary law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1789">In America, this theory has been put in practice. The Supreme Court of the United States is the one and only national court.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1790">It is charged with the interpretation of laws and of treaties; questions relating to maritime trade, and all those generally relating to the law of nations, are exclusively within its competence. You can even say that its attributions are almost entirely political, although its constitution is entirely <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>245<span class="bracket">]</span></span> judicial. Its unique purpose is to have the laws of the Union enforced. And the Union determines only the relations of the government with the governed and of the nation with foreigners; nearly all of the relations of citizens among themselves are governed by the sovereignty of the states.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1791">To this first cause of importance, another still greater must be added. In the nations of Europe, only individuals are subject to trial before the courts; but you can say that the Supreme Court of the United States makes sovereigns appear before it. When the bailiff, climbing the steps of the court, comes to proclaim these few words: “The State of New York versus the State of Ohio,” you feel that you are not within the realm of an ordinary court of justice. And when you consider that one of these litigants represents a million men, and the other, two million, you are astonished at the responsibility that weighs upon the seven judges whose decision is going to delight or sadden such a large number of their fellow citizens.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1792">In the hands of seven federal judges rest unceasingly the peace, prosperity, the very existence of the Union. Without them, the Constitution is a dead letter. To them, the executive power appeals in order to resist the encroachments of the legislative body; the legislature, to defend itself against the undertakings of the executive power; the Union, to make the states obey; the states, to repulse the exaggerated pretensions of the Union; public interest against private interest; the spirit of conservation against democratic instability. Their power is immense; but it is a power of opinion. They are omnipotent as long as the people consent to obey the law; they can do nothing once the people scorn the law. Now, the power of opinion is the most difficult one to exercise, because it is impossible to know its limits exactly. Often it is as dangerous to fall short, as to go beyond those limits.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1793">So the federal judges must be not only good citizens, learned and upright men, qualities necessary for all magistrates, but they must also be statesmen; they must know how to discern the spirit of the times, to brave the obstacles that can be overcome, and to change direction when the current threatens to carry away, with them, the sovereignty of the Union and the obedience due to its laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1794">The President can fail without having the State suffer, because the President has only a limited duty. Congress can go astray without having the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>246<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Union perish, because above Congress resides the electoral body that can change the spirit of Congress by changing its members.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1795">But if imprudent or corrupt men ever came to compose the Supreme Court, the confederation would have to fear anarchy or civil war.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1796">But make no mistake; the root cause of the danger is not in the constitution of the court, but in the very nature of federal governments. We have seen that nowhere is it more necessary to constitute a strong judicial power than among confederated peoples, because nowhere are individual existences, which can struggle against the social body, greater and in better condition to resist the use of the physical force of the government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1797">Now, the more necessary it is that a power be strong, the more scope and independence it must be given. The more extensive and independent a power, the more dangerous is the abuse that can be made of it. So the origin of the evil is not in the very constitution of this power, but in the very constitution of the State that necessitates the existence of such a power.</p>

<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_077">How the Federal Constitution Is Superior to the State Constitutions</h2>
<div class="opener">
<div id="lf1593-01_argument_037" class="argument">
<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1798"><span class="ital">How the Constitution of the Union can be compared to those of the individual states.—The superiority of the federal Constitution must be attributed particularly to the wisdom of the federal law-makers.—The legislature of the Union less dependent on the people than those of the states.—The executive power freer in its sphere.—The judicial power less subject to the desires of the majority.—Practical consequences of this.—The federal law-makers have mitigated the dangers inherent in democratic government; the law-makers of the states have heightened these dangers.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1799">The federal Constitution differs essentially from the constitutions of the states in the purpose that it intends, but it is highly similar in the means to achieve this purpose. The object of government is different, but the forms of government are the same. From this special point of view, they can usefully be compared.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>247<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1800">I think that the federal Constitution is superior to all of the state constitutions. This superiority stems from several causes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1801">The present Constitution of the Union was formed only after those of most of the states; so the Union could profit from acquired experience.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1802">You will be convinced, nonetheless, that this cause is only secondary, if you consider that, since the establishment of the federal Constitution, the American confederation has increased by eleven new states, and that these new states have nearly always exaggerated rather than mitigated the defects existing in the constitutions of their precursors.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1803">The great cause of the superiority of the federal Constitution is in the very character of the law-makers.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1804">At the time when it was formed, the ruin of the American confederation seemed imminent; it was obvious to all, so to speak. In this extremity, the people chose, perhaps not the men they loved most, but those they respected most.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1805">I have already pointed out above that nearly all the law-makers of the Union had been remarkable by their enlightenment and more remarkable still by their patriotism.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1806">They had all risen in the midst of a social crisis, during which the spirit of liberty had constantly to struggle against a strong and dominating authority. When the struggle ended, and while the excited passions of the crowd were, as usual, still fixed on combating dangers that for a long time no longer existed, these men had stopped; they had cast a calmer and more penetrating eye on their country; they had seen that a definitive revolution was accomplished, and that henceforth the perils that threatened the people could only arise from the abuses of liberty.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt811" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt811_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> What they thought, they had the courage to say, because deep in their hearts they felt a sincere and passionate love for this very liberty; they dared to speak of limiting it, because they were certain of not wanting to destroy it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt812" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt812_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">35</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>248<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1807">Most of the constitutions of the states give a term of one year to the house of representatives and two years to the senate. In this way the members of the legislative body are tied constantly and in the closest way to the slightest desires of their constituents.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1808">The law-makers of the Union thought that this extreme dependence of the legislature distorted the principal effects of the representative system, by placing in the people themselves not only the source of powers, but also the government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1809">They increased the length of the electoral mandate in order to allow the deputy greater use of his free will.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1810">The federal Constitution, like the different constitutions of the states, divided the legislative body into two branches.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1811">But in the states, these two parts of the legislature were composed of the same elements and followed the same mode of election. As a result, the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>249<span class="bracket">]</span></span> passions and will of the majority emerged as easily and found an organ and an instrument as rapidly in one as in the other of the houses. This gave a fierce and hasty character to the making of laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1812">The federal Constitution also had the two houses come out of the votes of the people; but it varied the conditions of eligibility and the mode of election. So, if one of the two legislative branches did not represent interests different from those represented by the other, as in certain nations, at least it represented a higher wisdom.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1813">To be a Senator you had to have reached a mature age; and a small assembly, itself already elected, was charged with the election.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1814">Democracies are naturally led to concentrate all social force in the hands of the legislative body. The latter, being the power that comes most directly from the people, is also the one that most partakes of the omnipotence of the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1815">So, in the legislative body, you notice an habitual tendency that leads it to gather all kinds of authority within itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1816">This concentration of powers, at the same time that it singularly harms the good management of public affairs, establishes the despotism of the majority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1817">The law-makers of the states have frequently surrendered to these democratic instincts; those of the Union always fought courageously against them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1818">In the states, executive power is placed in the hands of a magistrate who appears to be placed alongside the legislature, but who, in reality, is only a blind agent and passive instrument of its will. From where would he draw his strength? In the length of his term in office? Generally, he is named for only one year. In his prerogatives? He has, so to speak, none at all. The legislature can reduce him to impotence by granting the execution of its laws to special committees drawn from its midst. If it wanted, it could, in a way, nullify him by taking away his salary.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1819">The federal Constitution has concentrated all the rights of the executive power, as well as all of its responsibility, in a single man. It gave the President a four-year term; it assured him his salary during the entire length of his term in office; it created a group of supporters for him and armed him with a qualified veto. In a word, after carefully drawing the sphere of executive <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>250<span class="bracket">]</span></span> power, it sought, within this sphere, to give the executive power as strong and as free a position as possible.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1820">The judicial power, of all the powers, is the one that, in the state constitutions, remained least dependent on the legislative power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1821">Nonetheless, in all the states, the legislature retained the authority to set the salaries of judges, which necessarily subjected the former to immediate legislative influence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1822">In certain states, judges are appointed only for a time, which again removes a large part of their strength and freedom.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1823">In others, legislative and judicial powers are entirely mixed. The Senate of New York, for example, serves as the highest court of the state for certain trials.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1824">The federal Constitution has, on the contrary, carefully separated the judicial power from all the others. In addition, it made judges independent by declaring their salaries fixed and making their office irrevocable.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1825">The practical consequences of these differences are easy to see. It is clear to all attentive observers that the affairs of the Union are conducted infinitely better than the particular affairs of any state.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1826">The federal government is more just and more moderate in its action than the state governments. There is more wisdom in its views, more continuity and intelligent design in its projects, more skill, steadiness and firmness in the execution of its measures.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1827">A few words suffice to summarize this chapter.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1828">Two principal dangers menace the existence of democracies:</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1829">The complete subservience of the legislative power to the will of the electoral body.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1830">The concentration, in the legislative power, of all the other powers of government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1831">The law-makers of the states favored the development of these dangers. The law-makers of the Union did what they could to make them less to be feared.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1833">The United States of America has not presented the first and only example of a confederation. Without mentioning antiquity, modern Europe has furnished several. Switzerland, the German Empire, the Dutch Republic have been or still are confederations.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1834">When you study the constitutions of these different countries, you notice with surprise that the powers they confer on the federal government are more or less the same as those granted by the American Constitution to the government of the United States. Like the latter, they give the central power the right to make war or peace, the right to raise an army, to levy taxes, to provide for general needs and to regulate the common interests of the nation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1835">Among these different peoples, however, the federal government has almost always remained deficient and weak, while that of the Union conducts public affairs with vigor and ease.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1836">Even more, the first American Union could not continue to exist because of the excessive weakness of its government. Yet this government, so weak, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>252<span class="bracket">]</span></span> had received rights as extensive as the federal government of today. You can even say that in certain respects its privileges were greater.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt814" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt814_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1837">So several new principles are found in the current Constitution of the United States that are not striking at first, but make their influence profoundly felt.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1838">This Constitution, which at first sight you are tempted to confuse with previous federal constitutions, rests as a matter of fact on an entirely new theory that must stand out as a great discovery in the political science of today.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1839">In all the confederations that have preceded the American confederation of 1789, peoples who combined for a common purpose agreed to obey the injunctions of a federal government; but they retained the right to command and to supervise the execution of the laws of the Union at home.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1840">The American states that united in 1789 agreed not only that the federal government could dictate laws to them, but also that the federal government itself would execute its laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1841">In the two cases, the right is the same; only the exercise of the right is different. But this single difference produces immense results. [Such is the power of laws over the fate of societies.]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt815" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt815_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1842">In all the confederations that have preceded the American Union of today, the federal government, in order to provide for its needs, applied to the individual governments. In the case where the prescribed measure displeased one of them, the latter could always elude the need to obey. If it was strong it appealed to arms; if it was weak, it tolerated a resistance to the laws of the Union that had become its own, pretended weakness and resorted to the power of inertia.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1843">Consequently, one of these two things has constantly happened: the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>253<span class="bracket">]</span></span> most powerful of the united peoples, taking hold of the rights of the federal authority, has dominated all the others in its name;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt816" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt816_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">36</a> or the federal government has been left to its own forces. Then anarchy has become established among the confederated peoples, and the Union has fallen into impotence.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt817" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt817_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">37</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1844">In America, the Union governs not the states, but ordinary citizens. When it wants to levy a tax, it does not apply to the government of Massachusetts, but to each inhabitant of Massachusetts. Former federal governments faced peoples; the Union faces individuals. It does not borrow its strength, but draws upon its own. It has its own administrators, courts, officers of the law, and army.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1845">Certainly the national [<span class="ital">sic:</span> state] spirit, collective passions, provincial prejudices of each state still strongly tend to diminish the extent of federal power so constituted, and to create centers of resistance to the will of the federal power. Limited in its sovereignty, it cannot be as strong as a government that possesses complete sovereignty; but that is an evil inherent in the federal system.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1846">In America, each state has far fewer opportunities and temptations to resist; and if the thought occurs, the state can act on it only by openly violating the laws of the Union, by interrupting the ordinary course of justice, and by raising the standard of revolt. In a word, it must suddenly take an extreme position, something men hesitate to do for a long time.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1847">In former confederations, the rights granted to the Union were causes of war rather than of power, since these rights multiplied its demands without augmenting its means of enforcing obedience. Consequently, the real weakness of federal governments has almost always been seen to grow in direct proportion to their nominal power.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1848">This is not so for the American Union; the federal government, like most ordinary governments, can do everything that it has the right to do.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1849">The human mind invents things more easily than words; this is what causes the use of so many incorrect terms and incomplete expressions.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt818" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt818_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1850">Several nations form a permanent league and establish a supreme authority that, without acting on ordinary citizens as a national government could, nonetheless acts on each of the confederated peoples, taken as a group.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1851">This government, so different from all the others, is given the name federal.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1852">Next, a form of society is found in which several peoples truly blend together as one for certain common interests, and remain separate and only confederated for all the others.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1853">Here the central power acts without intermediary on the governed, administering and judging them as national governments do, but it acts this way only within a limited circle. Clearly that is no longer a federal government; it is an incomplete national government. So a form of government, neither precisely national nor federal, is found. But here things have stopped, and the new word needed to express the new thing does not yet exist.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt819" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt819_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1854">Because this new type of confederation was unknown, all unions have arrived at civil war, or slavery, or inertia. The peoples who composed them have all lacked either the enlightenment to see the remedy to their ills, or the courage to apply them.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1855">The first American Union had also lapsed into the same faults.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1856">But in America, the confederated states, before achieving independence, had been part of the same empire for a long time; so they had not yet contracted the habit of complete self-government, and national prejudices had not been able to become deeply rooted. Better informed than the rest of the world, they were equal to each other in enlightenment; they only weakly felt the passions that ordinarily, among peoples, resist the extension of federal power; and these passions were fought against by the greatest citizens. The Americans, at the same time that they felt the evil, resolutely envisaged the remedy. They corrected their laws and saved the country.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1858">Among small nations, society keeps its eye on everything; the spirit of improvement gets down to the smallest details. Since the weakness of the people profoundly tempers their ambition, their efforts and resources are <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>256<span class="bracket">]</span></span> almost entirely focused on their internal well-being and are not likely to be wasted on the empty illusion of glory. Since the capacities of each one are generally limited, desires are limited as well. The mediocrity of wealth makes conditions nearly equal; and mores have a simple and peaceful air. Thus, considering everything and taking into account various degrees of morality and enlightenment, more comfort, population and tranquillity are usually found in small nations than in large ones.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1859">When tyranny establishes itself within a small nation, it is more troublesome than anywhere else; acting inside a smaller circle, it extends to everything within this circle. Unable to undertake some great objective, it is busy with a multitude of small ones; it appears both violent and meddle-some. From the political world, which is strictly speaking its domain, it penetrates into private life. After dictating actions, it aspires to dictate tastes; after governing the State, it wishes to govern families. But that rarely happens; as a matter of fact, liberty forms the natural condition of small societies. There, government offers too little attraction to ambition, and the resources of individuals are too limited, for sovereign power to be easily concentrated in the hands of one man.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt821" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt821_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a> Should it happen, it is not difficult for the governed to unite together and, by a common effort, to overthrow the tyrant and the tyranny at the same time. [≠Liberty is, moreover, something so natural and so easy within a small nation that abuse can hardly be brought about.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1860">So small nations have at all times been the cradle of political liberty. It has happened that most of them have lost this liberty by growing larger, which clearly reveals that liberty is due to the small size of a people and not to the people themselves.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1861">The history of the world provides no example of a large nation that remained a republic for long;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt822" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt822_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">38</a> this has led men to say that the thing was impractical. As for me, I think that it is very imprudent for man to want to limit the possible and to judge the future; the real and the present elude <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>257<span class="bracket">]</span></span> him every day, and he finds himself constantly surprised by the unexpected in the things he knows best. What can be said with certainty is that the existence of a large republic will always be infinitely more at risk than that of a small one.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt823" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt823_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1862">All the passions fatal to republics grow with the extent of the territory, while the virtues that serve to support them do not increase in the same measure.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt824" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt824_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1863">The ambition of individuals increases with the power of the State; the strength of parties, with the importance of the end that they have in mind; but love of country, which must combat these destructive passions, is not stronger in a vast republic than in a small one. It would even be easy to prove that love of country there is less developed and less powerful. Great riches and profound poverty, large cities, depravity of mores, individual egoism, complexity of interests are so many perils that almost always result from the large size of the State. Several of these things do not harm the existence of a monarchy; some can even work toward its duration. In monarchies, moreover, government has a strength of its own; it makes use of the people and does not depend on them; the more numerous the people, the stronger the prince. But to these dangers, republican government can oppose only the support of the majority. Now, this element of strength is not proportionately more powerful in a vast republic than in a small one. Thus, while the means of attack constantly increase in number and power, the strength of resistance remains the same. It can even be said that it decreases, for the more numerous the people and the more varied the nature <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>258<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of minds and interests, the more difficult it is, as a result, to form a compact majority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1864">[≠Republican government is fragile by nature. It lasts much more because of the weakness of the attacks directed against it than because of a strength of its own [v: its own power]. It relies only on a certain sentiment of order, virtue and moderation on the part of the governed. The immoderate desires of parties, great riches and great poverty, vast cities, and the profound corruption of mores that they engender, constantly threaten the existence of republics. Now, all of these things are found only among large nations alone. A government that has the source of its power outside of the people can continue to exist for a long time, whatever the opinions of the people; but a republican government has strength only in the support of the majority; the more numerous the people, the harder to form a majority. Here my reasoning is based only upon a numerical calculation.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1865">We have been able to note, moreover, that human passions acquired intensity, not only from the greatness of the end that they wanted to attain, but also from the multitude of individuals who felt them at the same time. There is no one who does not find himself more moved in the middle of an agitated crowd that shares his emotion than if he were to feel it alone. In a large republic, political passions become irresistible, not only because the objective that they pursue is immense, but also because millions of men experience those political passions in the same way and at the same moment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1866">So it is permissible to say that, in general, nothing is so contrary to the well-being and to the liberty of men as large empires.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1867">Large States have particular advantages, however, that must be recognized.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1868">In them, the desire for power is more passionate among common men than elsewhere. So too the love of glory there is more developed among certain souls who find in the applause of a great people an objective that is worthy of their efforts and appropriate for raising them, in a way, above themselves. There, thought in all fields is given a more rapid and powerful impetus; ideas circulate more freely; large cities are like vast intellectual centers where all the lights of the human mind come to shine and combine. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>259<span class="bracket">]</span></span> This fact explains for us why large nations bring more rapid progress to enlightenment and to the general cause of civilization than small ones.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt825" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt825_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a> It must be added that important discoveries often require a development of national strength of which the government of a small people is incapable; among large nations, the government has a greater number of general ideas; it is more completely free from the routine of antecedents and from local egoism. There is more genius in its conceptions, more boldness in its ways of doing things.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1869">Internal well-being is more complete and more widespread among small nations as long as they remain at peace; but a state of war is more harmful to them than it is to large nations. In the latter, great distance from the borders sometimes allows most people to remain far from danger for centuries. For them, war is more a cause of discomfort than of ruin. [≠Large nations are at war more than small ones, but all things considered, among the large ones, there are more men at peace.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1870">Moreover, in this matter as in many others, there is a consideration that predominates over all the rest: that of necessity.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1871">If there were only small nations and not any large ones, humanity would certainly be freer and happier; but the existence of large nations cannot be avoided.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1872">This introduces into the world a new element of national prosperity, which is strength. What good is it for a people to present a picture of comfort and liberty, if they are exposed each day to devastation or conquest? What good is it that they have manufacturing and commerce, if another people commands the seas and establishes the law for all markets? Small nations are often miserable, not because they are small, but because they are weak; large nations prosper, not because they are large, but because they are strong. So for nations, strength is often one of the first conditions of happiness and even of existence. Because of that, barring particular circumstances, small peoples always end up being violently united with large ones or uniting with them on their own. I know of no condition more deplorable than that of a people able neither to defend itself nor to be self-sufficient.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>260<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1873">The federal system has been created to unite the various advantages that result from the large and the small sizes of nations.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt826" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt826_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1874">It is enough to look at the United States of America to see all the good that comes to those who adopt this system.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1875">Among large centralized nations, the legislator is forced to give laws a uniform character that does not allow for the diversity of places and mores; never learning about individual cases, he can only proceed by general rules. Men are then obliged to bend to the necessity of legislation, for legislation cannot adapt to the needs and mores of men; this is a great cause of trouble and misery.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt827" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt827_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1876">This disadvantage does not exist in confederations. The congress regulates the principal actions of social existence; all the detail is left to the provincial legislatures.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1877">You cannot imagine to what degree this division of sovereignty serves the well-being of each of the states that compose the Union. In these small societies, not preoccupied by the need to defend themselves or to expand, all public power and all individual energy are turned toward internal improvements.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt828" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt828_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a> The central government of each state, situated close to the governed, is alerted daily to needs that make themselves felt. Consequently, each year new plans are presented; these plans, discussed in town assemblies or the state legislature and then reproduced in the press, excite universal <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>261<span class="bracket">]</span></span> interest and the zeal of the citizens. This need to improve agitates the American republic constantly and does not trouble them; there, ambition for power is replaced by the love of well-being, a more vulgar, but less dangerous passion. It is an opinion generally shared in America that the existence and duration of republican forms in the New World depend on the existence and the duration of the federal system. A great part of the miseries engulfing the new States of South America is attributed to the desire to establish large republics there, instead of dividing sovereignty.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt829" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt829_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1878">As a matter of fact, it is incontestable that in the United States the taste and the practice of republican government were born in the towns and within the provincial assemblies. In a small nation such as Connecticut,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt830" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt830_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a> for example, where the important political matter is opening a canal or laying out a roadway, where the state has no army to pay nor war to sustain, and where the state can give to those who lead it neither wealth nor much glory, you can imagine nothing more natural and more appropriate to the nature of things than a republic. Now, this same republican spirit, these mores and these habits of a free people, after being born and developing in the various states, are then applied easily to the whole country. In a way, the public spirit of the Union is itself only a summary of provincial patriotism. Each citizen of the United States transfers, so to speak, the interest inspired in him by his small republic to the love of the common native land. By defending the Union, he defends the growing prosperity of his district, the right to direct its affairs, and the hope of winning acceptance there for the plans for improvement that are to enrich him himself: all things that ordinarily touch men more than the general interests of the country and the glory of the nation.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>262<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1879">On the other hand, if the spirit and the mores of the inhabitants make them more suitable than others to cause a large republic to prosper, the federal system has made the task much less difficult. The confederation of all the American states does not show the usual disadvantages of numerous human agglomerations. The Union is a large republic in terms of expanse; but in a way, it can be likened to a small republic, because of the small number of matters that concern its government. Its acts are important, but rare. Since the sovereignty of the Union is hindered and incomplete, the use of this sovereignty is not dangerous to liberty. Nor does it excite those immoderate desires for power and reputation that are so deadly to great republics. Since everything there does not necessarily end up at a common center, you see neither vast cities,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt831" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt831_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a> nor enormous wealth, nor great poverty, nor sudden revolutions. Political passions, instead of spreading instantaneously like a firestorm over the whole surface of the country, are going to break against the individual passions and interests of each state.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1880">Within the Union, however, ideas and things circulate freely, as among one and the same people. Nothing stops the rise of the spirit of enterprise. Its government draws upon talents and enlightenment. Within the boundaries of the Union, as within the interior of a country under the same empire, a profound peace reigns. Outside, the Union ranks among the most powerful nations of the world; it offers to foreign trade more than eight hundred leagues of coastline. Holding in its hands the keys to a whole world, it enforces respect for its flag in the far reaches of the seas.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt832" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt832_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>

Absolute truth is hidden and perhaps will always remain hidden.] The law-maker sometimes succeeds, after a thousand efforts, in exercising an indirect influence on the destiny of nations, and then his genius is celebrated. While often, the geographic <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>264<span class="bracket">]</span></span> position of the country, over which he has no influence; a social state that was created without his support; mores and ideas, whose origin is unknown to him; a point of departure that he does not know, impart to society irresistible movements that he struggles against in vain and that carry him along as well.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1884">The law-maker resembles a man who plots his route in the middle of the sea. He too can navigate the ship that carries him, but he cannot change its structure, raise the wind, or prevent the ocean from heaving under his feet.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1885">I have shown what advantages the Americans gain from the federal system. It remains for me to explain what allowed them to adopt this system; for not all peoples are able to enjoy its benefits.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1886">Accidental vices arising from the laws are found in the federal system; these can be corrected by law-makers. Others are encountered that are inherent in the system; these could not be destroyed by the peoples who adopt it. So these peoples must find within themselves the strength to withstand the natural imperfections of their government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1887">Among the vices inherent to all federal systems, the most visible of all is the complication of means that they use. This system necessarily brings two sovereignties face to face. The law-maker succeeds in making the movements of these two sovereignties as simple and as equal as possible, and he can enclose both of them within clearly defined spheres of action. But he cannot make it so that there is only one of them, nor prevent them from being in contact at some point.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1888">[The federal system of the United States consists of combining two governments: one, provincial; the other, national.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1889">It is already not so easy to find a people who have the taste and, above all, the habit of provincial government. I have already remarked earlier that, among enterprises that can be attempted, certainly one of the most difficult was to persuade men to attend to their own affairs. It follows that the federal system is hardly ever established except among nations who, independent of one another for a long time, have naturally contracted this taste and these habits to a high degree. Notably, this is what happened in the United States. Before the Revolution, they all recognized the authority of the mother country, but each of them had its individual government as well and did not depend on its neighbor.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1890">Nonetheless, the great difficulty is not finding some peoples who know how to run their own affairs, but finding some who can understand federal sovereignty and submit to it.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1891">So no matter what is done, the federal system rests on a complicated theory whose application requires, in the governed, the daily use of the light of their reason.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt834" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt834_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1892">In general, only simple conceptions take hold of the mind of the people. An idea that is false, but clear and precise, will always have more power in the world than a true, but complicated, idea. It follows that parties, which are like small nations within a large one, are always quick to adopt, as a symbol, a name or a principle that often represents only very incompletely the end that they propose and the means that they employ. But without this symbol, they would be able neither to subsist nor to stir. Governments that rest only on a single idea or single sentiment, easy to define, are perhaps not the best, but they are assuredly the strongest and the most durable.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1893">On the contrary, when you examine the Constitution of the United States, the most perfect of all known federal constitutions, you are alarmed by the many varieties of knowledge and by the discernment that it assumes among those whom it must govern. The government of the Union rests almost entirely on legal fictions. The Union is an ideal nation that exists only in the mind so to speak; intelligence alone reveals its extent and its limits.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1894">Once the general theory is well understood, the difficulties of application remain; they are innumerable, for the sovereignty of the Union is so entangled with the sovereignty of the states that it is impossible at first <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>266<span class="bracket">]</span></span> glance to perceive their limits. Everything is by convention and by artifice in such a government, and it can only suit a people accustomed, for a long time, to running their own affairs, a people among whom political knowledge has penetrated to the lowest levels of society. I have never admired the good sense and practical intelligence of the Americans more than in the way in which they escape the innumerable difficulties that arise from their federal constitution. I almost never met a common man in America who did not, with surprising ease, discriminate between the obligations arising from the laws of Congress and those originating in the laws of his state, and who, after distinguishing the matters that were among the general attributions of the Union from those that the local legislature had to regulate, could not indicate the point at which the jurisdiction of the federal courts began and the limit at which that of the state courts ended.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1895">The Constitution of the United States resembles those beautiful creations of human industry that shower glory and wealth on those who invent them, but that remain sterile in other hands.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1896">This is what Mexico has demonstrated in our times.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1897">The inhabitants of Mexico, wanting to establish the federal system, took as a model and almost completely copied the federal constitution of the Anglo-Americans, their neighbors.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt835" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt835_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">39</a> But while importing the letter of the law, they could not at the same time import the spirit that gives it life. So they are seen constantly encumbered by the mechanism of their double government. The sovereignty of the states and that of the Union, leaving the circle that the constitution had drawn, penetrate each other daily. Still today, Mexico is constantly dragged from anarchy to military despotism, and from military despotism to anarchy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1898">[But even if a people were advanced enough in civilization and versed enough in the art of government to submit intelligently to so complicated a political theory, it would still not mean that the federal system could meet all their needs.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1900">The second and more destructive of all the vices, which I regard as inherent in the federal system itself, is the relative weakness of the government of the Union.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1901">The principle on which all confederations rest is the division of sovereignty. Law-makers make this division hardly noticeable; they even hide it from view for awhile, but they cannot keep it from existing. Now, divided sovereignty will always be weaker than complete sovereignty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1902">In the account of the Constitution of the United States, we saw how artfully the Americans, while enclosing the power of the Union within the limited circle of federal governments, succeeded in giving it the appearance and, to a certain extent, the strength of a national government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1903">By acting in this way, the law-makers of the Union reduced the natural danger of confederations; but they were not able to make it disappear entirely.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1904">The American government, it is said, does not address itself to the states; it applies its injunctions directly to the citizens and bends them, separately, to the work of the common will.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1905">But if federal law collided with the interests and prejudices of a state, should it not be feared that each of the citizens of this state would believe himself interested in the cause of the man who refuses to obey? When all the citizens of the state found themselves thus harmed at the same time and in the same way by the authority of the Union, the federal government would seek in vain to isolate them in order to combat them. They would instinctively feel that they must unite to defend themselves, and in the portion of sovereignty left for their state to enjoy, they would find an organization already prepared. Fiction would then disappear and give way to reality, and you would be able to see the organized power of one part of the territory joining battle with the central authority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1906">[This is, moreover, the spectacle most recently presented by South Carolina. The regulations of the United States concerning the tariff had become completely unpopular in Carolina; the state legislature took the initiative and suspended the enforcement of the federal law. This result is inevitable. When the interest or passions of men are left a powerful means of satisfaction, you can be assured that legal fictions will not long prevent them from noticing and making use of that means. ≠This is so well understood <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>268<span class="bracket">]</span></span> even in America that, no matter how large certain states already are, care has been taken not to create district assemblies that could represent a collective resistance. The legislature never has to make anything obey, other than towns, without links to each other.≠</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1907">Former federal constitutions obliged the states to <span class="ital">act.</span> The Constitution of the United States only obliges them to <span class="ital">allow action,</span> an essential difference that makes resistance very rare; for it is very much easier to refuse to act than to prevent someone else from acting. But once what you resolved simply to endure reaches a certain level of pain, the reluctance that men have to take initiative does not take long to disappear, and the precaution of the law-maker is found wanting.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1908">The principle of federal law is that the Court of the United States must endeavor to judge only individuals. In this way, it does [not (ed.)] generally attack the laws of the states, which reduces the danger of a collision between the two sovereignties. But if, in a particular interest, it violates an important state law, or harms a general state principle or interest, the precautions of the law-maker are again useless; and the struggle, real if not obvious, is between the harmed state, represented by a citizen, and the Union, represented by its courts. The Constitution gives the Union … [text of note 40 (ed.)].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1909">It is enough, moreover, to see in what a persuading and conciliatory manner the federal government calls for the execution of laws, in order to judge that, despite appearances and the efforts of the law-maker, the federal government constantly finds itself facing not individuals, but sovereigns.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1910">It is even easy to go further, and it must be said with the famous Hamilton in the <span class="ital">Federalist</span> that of the two sovereignties, the stronger is assuredly the sovereignty of the state.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1911">You can even go further … [cf. infra (ed.)] …]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1912">I will say as much about the federal judicial system. If, in a particular trial, the courts of the Union violated an important state law, the real, if not obvious, struggle would be between the harmed state, represented by a citizen, and the Union, represented by its courts.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt836" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt836_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">40</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1913">You must have little experience in the ways of this world to imagine that, after leaving the passions of men a means of satisfaction, you will always prevent them, with the aid of legal fictions, from noticing and making use of that means.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1914">So the American law-makers, while making the struggle between the sovereignties less probable, did not destroy the causes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1915">You can even go further and say that they were not able to secure preponderance to the federal power in case of conflict.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt837" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt837_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1916">They gave the Union money and soldiers, but the states retain the love and the prejudices of the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1917">The sovereignty of the Union is an abstract thing connected to only a small number of external matters. The sovereignty of the states is felt by all the senses; it is understood without difficulty; every moment, it is seen in action. One is new; the other was born with the people themselves.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1918">The sovereignty of the Union is a work of art. The sovereignty of the states is natural; it exists by itself, without effort, like the authority of the father of a family.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1919">The sovereignty of the Union touches men only through a few general interests; it represents an immense and distant country, a vague and indefinite sentiment. The sovereignty of the states envelops each citizen in a way and catches him every day by details. It is the state that takes responsibility <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>270<span class="bracket">]</span></span> for guaranteeing his prosperity, his liberty, his life; at every moment, it influences his well-being or his misery. The sovereignty of the states rests on memories, on habits, on local prejudices, on the egoism of province and of family; in a word, on all the things that make the instinct for native land so powerful in the heart of man. How can its advantages be doubted?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1920">Since the law-makers cannot prevent the occurrence of dangerous collisions between the two sovereignties that are brought face to face by the federal system, their efforts to turn confederated peoples away from war must be joined with particular dispositions that carry them toward peace.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1921">It follows that the federal pact cannot exist for long if, among the peoples to whom it applies, a certain number of conditions for union are not found that make this common life easy for them and facilitate the task of government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1922">Thus, to succeed, the federal system needs not only good laws, but also favorable circumstances.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1923">All peoples who have been seen to form a confederation have had a certain number of common interests that serve as the intellectual bonds of the association.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1924">But beyond material interests, man still has ideas and sentiments. For a confederation to last for a long time, there must be no less homogeneity in the civilization than in the needs of the diverse peoples who constitute it. The civilization of a <span class="ital">canton</span> in Vaud compared with that of a <span class="ital">canton</span> in Uri is like the XIXth century compared with the XVth; so Switzerland has never truly had a federal government. The union among the different <span class="ital">cantons</span> exists only on the map; and that would be clearly seen if a central authority wanted to apply the same laws over the whole territory.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt838" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt838_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>271<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1925">[There are men who pretend that one of the advantages of federal constitutions is to allow each portion of the same empire to live entirely in its own way, without ceasing to be united. That is true, if confederation means a kind of offensive and defensive league, by means of which different peoples unite to repel a common danger and remain strangers to each other for everything else. But if, among confederated peoples, you want to create a common existence and a true national government, it is absolutely necessary that their civilization be homogeneous in nature. This necessity makes itself felt even much more in confederations than in monarchies, because in order to be obeyed, government has much more need for the support of the governed in the first than in the second.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1926">The federal system allows and favors diversity in laws dealing with specifics, which is a great good; but it often resists uniformity in general laws, which is a great evil.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1927">In the United States there is a fact that admirably facilitates the existence of the federal government. The different states not only have more or less the same interests, the same origin and the same language, but also the same degree of civilization; this almost always makes agreement among them easy. I do not know if there exists any European nation, however small, that, in its different parts, does not present a less homogeneous face than the American people whose territory is as large as half of Europe.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1928">From the state of Maine to the state of Georgia, there are about four hundred leagues. However, less difference exists between the civilization of Maine and that of Georgia than between the civilization of Normandy and that of Brittany. So Maine and Georgia, placed at two extremities of a vast <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>272<span class="bracket">]</span></span> empire, naturally find more real ease in forming a confederation, than Normandy and Brittany, which are separated only by a stream.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1929">With these opportunities, which the mores and habits of a people offer to the American law-makers, are joined others that arise from the geographic position of the country. It is principally to the latter that the adoption and maintenance of the federal system must be attributed.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt839" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt839_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1930">[Despite all these obstacles, I believe federal governments still more appropriate for maintaining internal peace and for favoring, over a vast empire, the peaceful development of social well-being, than for struggling with advantage against foreign enemies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1931">It is the difficulty that confederations find in sustaining great wars that makes so many peoples incapable of enduring federal government.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1932">The most important of all the actions that can mark the life of a people is war. In war, a people acts as a single individual vis-à-vis foreign peoples; it fights for its very existence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1933">As long as it is only a question of maintaining peace within the interior of a country and of favoring prosperity, skill in the government, reason among the governed, and a certain natural attachment that men almost always have for their country can easily suffice. But for a nation to be able to wage a great war, the citizens must impose numerous and painful sacrifices on themselves. To believe that a large number of men will be capable of submitting themselves to such social exigencies, is to know humanity very badly. [Were the necessity of war to be universally acknowledged, the natural inclination of the human mind is to reject the annoying consequences <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>273<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of the principle that it previously accepted. So once the principle of war is accepted, an authority capable of forcing individuals to bear its consequences must be found somewhere.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1934">It follows that all peoples who have had to wage great wars have been led, almost despite themselves, to augment the forces of the government. Those who have not been able to succeed in doing so have been conquered. A long war almost always puts nations in this sad alternative; their defeat delivers them to destruction, and their triumph, to despotism.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1935">[There is a great nation in Europe where the forces of society [v: governmental forces] are centralized in such a way that in case of war, a drum-beat assembles the entire nation, so to speak, around its leader, like the inhabitants of a village. This nation, apart from its courage, must have a great advantage over others for waging war; on several occasions, therefore, we have seen it dominate all of Europe by force of arms.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1936">The fact is that to draw from people the enormous sacrifices of men and money that war requires and to concentrate, in one place and at a given time, all national forces, nothing less is required than the efforts of complete sovereignty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1937">Now, the inevitable evil of confederations, I have already said, is the division of sovereignty. In the federal system, not only is there no administrative centralization or anything approaching it, but also governmental centralization itself exists only very incompletely. That is always a great cause of weakness when it is a question of defense against peoples among whom governmental centralization exists.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1938">In the federal Constitution of the United States … [cf. infra (ed.)]].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1939">So, in general, it is during a war that the weakness of a government is revealed in a most visible and dangerous manner; and I have shown that the inherent vice of federal governments was to be very weak.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1940">In the federal system, not only is there no administrative centralization or anything approaching it, but also governmental centralization itself exists only incompletely. That is always a great cause of weakness, when defense is necessary against peoples among whom governmental centralization is complete.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1941">In the federal Constitution of the United States, of all federal constitutions, the one where the central government is vested with the most real <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>274<span class="bracket">]</span></span> strength, this evil still makes itself acutely felt. [The law gives Congress, it is true, the right to take all measures required by the interest of the country, but the difficulty is to exercise such a right. If Congress, pressed by urgent needs, comes to impose on the governed sacrifices equal to the dangers, the discontent of those individuals who suffer does not fail to find a place of support in the sovereignty of the states, or at least in the ambition of those who lead the states and who, in turn, want the support of the malcontents. The states that do not want to wage war, or to whom the war is useless or harmful, easily find in the interpretation of the Constitution the means to refuse their support. The physical and, above all, the moral force of the nation is considerably reduced by it, for even the possibility of such an event renders the federal government weak and slow to act; it fills the government with hesitations and fears and prevents it from even attempting all that it could do.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1942">“It is evident,” says Hamilton in the <span class="ital">Federalist,</span> no. 12, “from the state of the country, from the habits of the people, from the experience we have had on the point itself that it is impracticable to raise any very considerable sums by direct taxation.” The direct tax is in fact the most visible and burdensome of taxes; but at the same time, it is the only one that can always be resorted to during a war.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1943">A single example will allow the reader to judge.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1944">The Constitution gives Congress the right to call the state militias into active duty when it is a matter of suppressing an insurrection or repelling an invasion. Another article says that in this case the President of the United States is the Commander in Chief of the militia.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1945">At the time of the War of 1812, the President ordered the militias of the North to move toward the national borders; Connecticut and Massachusetts, whose interests were harmed by the war, refused to send their contingents.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1946">The Constitution, they said, authorizes the federal government to use the militias in cases of <span class="ital">insurrection</span> or <span class="ital">invasion;</span> but in the present situation there was neither insurrection nor invasion. They added that the same Constitution that gave the Union the right to call the militias into active service, left the states the right to appoint the officers. It followed, according to them, that even in war, no officer of the Union had the right to command <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>275<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the militias, except the President in person. But this was a matter of serving in an army commanded by someone other than him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1947">These absurd and destructive doctrines received not only the sanction of the Governors and the legislature, but also that of the courts of justice of these two states; and the federal government was forced to find elsewhere the troops that it needed.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt840" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt840_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">41</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1948">[A fact of this nature proves, better than all that I could say, the inability the American Union would have to sustain a great war, even with the improved organization that the 1789 Constitution gave it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1949">Allow for a moment the existence of such a nation in the midst of the aggressive peoples of Europe where sovereignty is unified and omnipotent, and the relative weakness of the American Union will become for you a proven and plain truth.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1950">So how is it that the American Union, all protected as it is by the relative perfection of its laws, does not dissolve in the middle of a great war? It is because it has no great wars to fear.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt842" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt842_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1951">[In general, we must give up citing the example of the United States to prove that confederations can sustain great wars, for the Union has never had a single one of this nature.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1952">Even that of 1812, which the Americans speak about with such pride, was nothing compared to the smallest of those that the ambition of Louis XIV or the French Revolution brought about in Europe. The reason is simple.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1953">Placed in the center of an immense continent, where human industry <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>276<span class="bracket">]</span></span> can expand without limits, the Union is almost as isolated from the world as if it were enclosed on all sides by the ocean.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt843" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt843_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1954">Canada numbers only a million inhabitants; its population is divided into two enemy nations. The rigors of climate limit the extent of its territory and close its ports for six months of the year.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1955">From Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, there are still a few, half-destroyed, savage tribes that six thousand soldiers<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt844" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt844_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a> drive before them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1956">In the South, the Union at one point touches the empire of Mexico; probably great wars will come from there one day [if the Anglo-Americans and the Mexicans each continue to form a single, unified nation. In Mexico, in fact, there is a numerous population that, different from its neighbors by language, religion, habits and interest [broken text (ed.)]]. But, for a long time still, the little developed state of its civilization, the corruption of its mores and its poverty will prevent Mexico from taking an elevated rank among nations. As for the great powers of Europe, their distance makes them little to be feared.<a href="#n014" id="n014_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">O</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1957">So the great happiness of the United States is not to have found a federal constitution that allows it to sustain great wars, but to be so situated that there are none to fear.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1958">No one can appreciate more than I the advantages of the federal system. There I see one of the most powerful devices favoring prosperity and human liberty. I envy the fate of nations permitted to adopt it. But I refuse, nonetheless, to believe that confederated republics could struggle for long, with equal strength, against a nation where governmental power would be centralized.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1959">The people who, in the presence of the great military monarchies of Europe, would come to divide sovereignty, would seem to me to abdicate, by this fact alone, its power and perhaps its existence and its name.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1968">First I must establish a great division among parties.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1969">There are countries so vast that the different populations living there, though united under the same sovereignty, have contradictory interests that give rise to a permanent opposition among them. Then, the various portions of the same people do not form parties strictly speaking, but distinct nations; and if civil war happens to break out, there is a conflict between rival peoples rather than a struggle between factions.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1972">Parties are an evil inherent in free governments; but they do not have the same character and the same instincts in all periods of time.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1973">There are periods of time when nations feel tormented by such great ills that the idea of a total change in their political constitution occurs to their mind. There are other periods when the malaise is even more profound and when the social state itself is compromised. That is the time of great revolutions and great parties.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1974">Between these centuries of disorders and miseries, you find others when societies are at rest and when the human race seems to catch its breath. In truth, that is still only outward appearance. The march of time does not stop for peoples any more than for men; both advance each day toward an unknown future; and when we believe them stationary, it is because their movements escape us. They are men who are walking; to those who are running, they seem immobile.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1975">[&lt;Similar to the hand that marks the hours; everyone can tell the path it has already followed, but the hand must be watched for a long time to discover that it is moving.&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1976">Be that as it may, there are periods when the changes that take place in the political constitution and social state of peoples are so slow and so imperceptible, that men think they have arrived at a final state; the human mind then believes itself firmly seated on certain foundations and does not look beyond a certain horizon.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1977">This is the time of intrigues and of small parties.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1978">What I call great political parties are those that are attached to principles more than to their consequences, to generalities and not to particular cases, to ideas and not to men. In general, these parties have more noble traits, more generous passions, more real convictions, a more candid and bold appearance than the others. Here, particular interest, which always plays the greatest role in political passions, hides more cleverly behind the veil of public interest; sometimes it even manages to hide from the view of those whom it arouses and brings into action.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1979">Small parties, on the contrary, are generally without political faith. Since they do not feel elevated and sustained by great objectives, their character is stamped by an egoism that occurs openly in each of their acts. They get worked up from a cold start; their language is violent, but their course is <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>281<span class="bracket">]</span></span> timid and uncertain. The means they use are miserable, like the very end that they propose. That is why, when a time of calm follows a violent revolution, great men seem suddenly to disappear and souls withdraw into themselves.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1980">Great parties turn society upside down; small ones trouble it; the ones tear it apart and the others deprave it. [&lt;Both have a common trait, however: to reach their ends, they hardly ever use means that conscience approves completely. There are honest men in nearly all parties, but it can be said that no party should be called an honest man.&gt;] The first sometimes save society by shaking it up; the second always disturb it to no profit.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1981">America had great parties; today they no longer exist. From that it has gained a great deal in happiness, but not in morality.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt849" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt849_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>282<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1982">When the War of Independence finally ended and it was a matter of establishing the foundations of the new government, the nation found itself divided between two opinions. These opinions were as old as the world, and they are found under different forms and given various names in all free societies. One wanted to limit popular power; the other, to expand it indefinitely.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1983">Among the Americans, the struggle between these two opinions never took on the violent character that has often marked it elsewhere. In America, the two parties were in agreement on the most essential points. Neither one had to destroy an old order or turn an entire social state upside down in order to win. Consequently, neither one bound a large number of individuals’ lives to the triumph of its principles. But they touched upon non-material interests of the first order, such as love of equality and of independence. That was enough to arouse violent passions.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1984">The party that wanted to limit popular power sought, above all, to apply its doctrines to the Constitution of the Union, which earned it the name <span class="ital">Federalist.</span></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1985">The other, which claimed to be the exclusive lover of liberty, took the title <span class="ital">Republican.</span><a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt850" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt850_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>283<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1986">America is the land of democracy. So the Federalists were always a minority; but they counted in their ranks nearly all the great men who had emerged from the War of Independence, and their moral power was very extensive. Circumstances, moreover, favored them. The ruin of the first confederation made the people afraid of falling into anarchy, and the Federalists profited from this temporary frame of mind. For ten or twelve years, they led affairs and were able to apply, not all of their principles, but some of them; for, day by day, the opposing current became too violent for anyone to dare to struggle against it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1987">In 1801, the Republicans finally took possession of the government. Thomas Jefferson was named President; he brought them the support of a celebrated name, a great talent, and an enormous popularity.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1988">The Federalists had only survived thanks to artificial means and with the aid of temporary resources; the virtue or talents of their leaders, as well as the good fortune of circumstances, had brought them to power. When the Republicans, in turn, gained power, the opposing party was as if enveloped by a sudden flood. An immense majority declared against it, and the party found itself at once in such a small minority that it immediately gave up hope. From that moment, the Republican or Democratic party has marched from conquest to conquest and has taken possession of the entire society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1989">The Federalists, feeling defeated, without resources, and finding themselves isolated within the nation, divided; some joined the victors; others put down their banner and changed their name. They entirely ceased to exist as a party a fairly great number of years ago.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1990">The transitional period when the Federalists held power is, in my opinion, one of the most fortunate events that accompanied the birth of the great American union. The Federalists struggled against the irresistible inclination of their century and country. Their theories, however excellent or flawed, had the fault of being inapplicable as a whole to the society that the Federalists wanted to govern; so what happened under Jefferson would <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>284<span class="bracket">]</span></span> have happened sooner or later. But at least their government let the new republic have time to get established and allowed it afterward to bear, without difficulty, the rapid development of the doctrines that they had fought. A great number of their principles ended up, moreover, being accepted into the creed of their adversaries; and the federal Constitution, which still continues to exist in our time, is a lasting monument to their patriotism and wisdom.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt851" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt851_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1991">So today great political parties are not seen in the United States. Parties that threaten the future of the Union abound there; but none exist that appear to attack the present form of government and the general course of society. The parties that threaten the Union rest, not on principles, but on material interests. In the different provinces of so vast an empire, these interests constitute rival nations rather than parties.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt852" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt852_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> That is how the North <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>285<span class="bracket">]</span></span> was recently seen to uphold the system of commercial tariffs, and the South, to take arms in favor of free trade. The sole reason is that the North engages in manufacturing and the South in agriculture,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt853" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt853_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> and the restrictive system works to the profit of the one and to the detriment of the other.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1992">For lack of great parties, the United States swarms with small ones, and public opinion splinters infinitely on questions of details. The pain that is taken there to create parties cannot be imagined; it is not an easy thing to do in our time.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt854" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt854_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> In the United States, there is no religious hatred, because religion is universally respected and no one sect is dominant; no class hatred, because the people are everything and no one still dares to struggle against them; finally there are no public miseries to exploit, because the material state of the country offers such an enormous scope to industry that leaving man to himself is enough for him to work wonders. But [particular] ambition must indeed succeed in creating parties, because it is difficult to throw someone who holds power out of office for the sole reason that you want to take his place. So all the skill of politicians consists of forming parties. A politician, in the United States, seeks first to discern his interest and to see what analogous interests could be grouped around his; then he busies himself finding out if, by chance, a doctrine or principle exists in the world that could be placed conveniently at the head of the new association, to give it the right to come into being and to circulate freely. It amounts to what would be called the license of the king that our fathers used to print on the first sheet of their works and incorporated into the book, even though it was not part of it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt855" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt855_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>286<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1993">This done, the new power is introduced into the political world.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1994">To a foreigner, nearly all the domestic quarrels of the Americans seem, at first view, incomprehensible or childish, and you do not know if you should pity a people who seriously keeps itself busy with such miseries or envy it the good fortune of being able to keep busy in that way.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1995">But when you come carefully to study the secret instincts that govern factions in America, you easily discover that most of them are more or less linked with one or the other of the two great parties that have divided men since free societies have existed. As you enter more profoundly into the intimate thought of these parties, you notice that some of them work to narrow the use of public power, others, to expand it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1996">I am not saying that American parties always have as their open aim, or even as their hidden aim, making aristocracy or democracy prevail in the country. I am saying that aristocratic or democratic passions are easily found at the bottom of all the parties, and, although hidden from view, they form the tender spot and the soul of the parties.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1997">I will cite a recent example. The President attacks the Bank of the United States. The country is aroused and divided; the enlightened classes generally side with the Bank; the people favor the President. Do you think that the people knew how to discern the reasons for their opinion in the middle of the twists and turns of such a difficult question, where experienced men hesitate? Not at all. But the Bank is a great establishment that has an independent existence; the people, who destroy or raise all powers, can do nothing to it; that astonishes them. Amid the universal movement of society, this immobile point shocks their sight, and they want to see if they cannot succeed in getting it moving like the rest.</p>

<div class="opener">
<div id="lf1593-01_argument_042" class="argument">
<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1998"><span class="ital">Secret opposition of the rich to democracy.—They withdraw into private life.—Taste that they show inside their residences for exclusive pleasures and luxury.—Their simplicity outside.— Their affected condescension for the people.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_1999">Sometimes among a people divided by opinions, when the equilibrium among parties is broken, one of them acquires an irresistible preponderance. It crushes all obstacles, overwhelms its adversary and exploits the entire society to its profit. The vanquished, then despairing of success, hide or fall silent. A universal immobility and silence develop. The nation seems united by the same idea. The conquering party stands up and says: “I have brought peace to the country; you owe me thanks.”</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2000">But beneath this apparent unanimity, profound divisions and a real opposition are still hidden.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2001">This is what happened in America. When the democratic party gained preponderance, you saw it take exclusive possession of the leadership of public affairs. Since then, it has not ceased to model the mores and laws after its desires.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt856" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt856_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2002">Today you can say that, in the United States, the wealthy classes of society are almost entirely out of public affairs, and that wealth, far from being a right, is a real cause of disfavor and an obstacle to reaching power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2003">So the rich prefer abandoning the contest to sustaining an often unequal struggle against the poorest of their fellow citizens. Not being able to take a rank in public life analogous to the one they occupy in private life, they <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>288<span class="bracket">]</span></span> abandon the first in order to concentrate on the second. In the middle of the State, they form something like a society apart with its own tastes and enjoyments.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2004">The rich man submits to this state of things as to an evil without remedy; with great care, he even avoids showing that it wounds him. So you hear him publicly praise the sweet pleasures of republican government and the advantages of democratic forms. For, next to hating their enemies, what is more natural to men than flattering them?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2005">Do you see this opulent citizen? Wouldn’t you say, a Jew of the Middle Ages who is afraid of arousing suspicion of his wealth? His attire is simple; his gait is modest. Within the four walls of his dwelling, he adores luxury; into this sanctuary, he lets only a few chosen guests that he arrogantly calls his equals. You meet no nobleman in Europe who appears more exclusive in his pleasures than he, more envious of the slightest advantages that a privileged position assures. But here he is, leaving his house, to go to work in a tiny, dusty room that he occupies in the business center of the city, where everyone is free to come to meet him. Along his path, his shoemaker happens by, and they stop. They begin to converse with each other. What can they be saying? These two citizens are dealing with the affairs of the State, and they will not part without shaking hands.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2006">At the bottom of this enthusiasm for convention and in the midst of these obsequious forms toward the dominant power, it is easy to notice in the rich a great disgust for the democratic institutions of their country. The people are a power that they fear and despise. If, one day, the bad government of democracy led to a political crisis, if monarchy ever presented itself in the United States as something feasible, you would soon discover the truth of what I am advancing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2007">The two great weapons that parties use to succeed are newspapers and associations.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt857" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt857_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2009">Freedom of the press not only makes its power felt over political opinions, but also over all of the opinions of men. It modifies not only laws, but also mores. In another part of this work, I will seek to determine the degree of influence that freedom of the press has exercised over civil society in the United States; I will try to discern the direction it has given to ideas, the habits it has imparted to the mind and sentiments of the Americans.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt858" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt858_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a> For now, I only want to examine the effects produced by freedom of the press in the political world.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2010">[{The greatest problem of modern societies is to know how to use freedom of the press.} I love freedom of the press enough to have the courage to say everything that I think about it.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2011">I admit that to freedom of the press I do not bring that complete and instantaneous love that is given to things supremely good by their nature. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>290<span class="bracket">]</span></span> [I do not see freedom of the press in the same way that I consider <span class="ital">patriotism</span> or <span class="ital">virtue,</span> for example.]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt859" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt859_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> I love it much more from consideration of the evils it prevents than for the good things that it does.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt860" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt860_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2012">If someone showed me an intermediate position where I could hope to stand firm between complete independence and total subservience of thought, I would perhaps take my position there; but who will find this intermediate position?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt861" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt861_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> You start from license of the press, and you march in rank order; what do you do? First, you submit writers to juries. But the juries acquit them, and what was only the opinion of an isolated man becomes the opinion of the country. So you have done too much and too little. You have to move further. You deliver authors to permanent magistrates; but judges are obliged to hear before condemning. What someone was afraid to avow in a book, is proclaimed with impunity in the defense plea. Thus, what was said obscurely in one account is found repeated in a thousand others. The expression is the external form, and, if I can express myself in this way, the body of the thought; but it is not the thought itself. Your courts arrest the body, but the soul escapes them and subtly slips through their hands. So you have done too much and too little; you must <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>291<span class="bracket">]</span></span> continue to move.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt862" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt862_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> Finally you abandon writers to censors. Very good; we are getting closer. But isn’t the political rostrum free? So you still haven’t done anything. I am wrong; you have made things worse. Would you, by chance, take thought for one of those material powers that grow with the number of their agents? Would you count writers like soldiers in an army? In contrast to all material powers, the power of thought often increases with the small number of those who express it. The spoken word of a powerful man, which spreads alone through the passions of a silent assembly, has more power than the confused cries of a thousand orators. And if only someone can speak freely in a single public place, it is as if he has spoken publicly in each village. So you must destroy the freedom to speak as well as to write. This time, here you are at your destination: everyone is quiet. But where have you arrived? You began from the abuses of liberty, and I find you under the feet of a despot.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2013">You have gone from extreme independence to extreme servitude without finding, on such a long journey, a single place where you could rest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2014">Some peoples, apart from the general reasons that I have just set forth, have particular reasons that must attach them to freedom of the press.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2015">In certain nations claiming to be free, each of the agents of power can violate the law with impunity, and the constitution of the country does not give the oppressed the right to complain to the judicial system. Among these peoples, the independence of the press must no longer be considered as one of the guarantees, but as the sole remaining guarantee for liberty and for the security of the citizens.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2016">So if the men who govern these nations spoke about taking independence away from the press, the whole people could respond to them: Allow <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>292<span class="bracket">]</span></span> us to prosecute your crimes before ordinary judges, and perhaps then we will consent not to appeal to the court of opinion.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt863" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt863_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2017">In a country where the dogma of sovereignty of the people openly reigns, censorship is not only a danger, but also a great absurdity.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt864" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt864_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2018">When you grant each person a right to govern society, you must recognize his capacity to choose between the different opinions that trouble his contemporaries and to appreciate the different facts, the knowledge of which can guide him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2019">So sovereignty of the people and freedom of the press are two entirely correlative things. Censorship and universal suffrage are, on the contrary, two things that contradict each other and that cannot exist together for long in the political institutions of the same people. Among the twelve million men who live within the territory of the United States, <span class="ital">not a single one</span> has yet dared to propose limiting freedom of the press.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2020">When I arrived in America, the first newspaper that came before my eyes contained the following article, which I translate faithfully:</p>
<div class="cit">
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2021">Throughout the whole of this affair, the tone and language of Jackson [the President] was that of a heartless despot, alone intent on preserving his power. Ambition is his crime and will yet prove his curse. Intrigue is his vocation, and will yet overthrow and confound him. Corruption is his element and will yet react upon him to his utter dismay and confusion. He has been a successful as well as a desperate political gangster, but the hour of retribution is at hand; he must disgorge his winnings, throw away his false dice, and seek the hermitage, there to blaspheme and execrate his folly, for to repent is not a virtue within the capacity of his heart to obtain (<span class="ital">Vincennes Gazette</span>).</p>

<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>293<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2022">Many men in France imagine that the violence of the press among us is due to the instability of the social state, to our political passions and to the general malaise that follows. So they are constantly waiting for a time when, after society has regained a tranquil footing, the press in turn will become calm. As for me, I would willingly attribute the extreme ascendancy that the press has over us to the causes indicated above; but I do not think that these causes influence its language much. The periodical press seems to me to have its own instincts and passions, apart from the circumstances in which it works. What happens in American really proves it for me.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2023">America is perhaps at this moment the country in the world that contains within it the fewest seeds of revolution. In America, nevertheless, the press has the same destructive tastes as in France, and the same violence without the same reasons for anger. [&lt;≠Most often it feeds on hate and envy; it speaks more to passions than to reason; it spreads falsehood and truth all jumbled together.≠&gt;] In America, as in France, the press is an extraordinary power, a strange mixture of good and evil; liberty cannot live without it and order can hardly be maintained with it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt865" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt865_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2024">What must be said is that the press has much less power in the United States than among us. Nothing, however, is rarer in that country than seeing a judicial proceeding directed against the press. The reason is simple: the Americans, while accepting among themselves the dogma of sovereignty of the people, have applied it sincerely. They did not have the idea of establishing, with elements that change every day, constitutions that endured forever. So to attack existing laws is not criminal, as long as you do not want to evade them by violence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2025">They believe, moreover, that the courts are powerless to moderate the press; that because the flexibility of human languages constantly escapes judicial analysis, crimes of this nature in a way slip out of the hand that reaches out to seize them. They think that to be able to act effectively on the press, a court would have to be found that was not only devoted to the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>294<span class="bracket">]</span></span> existing order, but was also able to stand above the public opinion that stirs around it, a court that judged without allowing publicity, ruled without justifying its decisions, and punished the intention even more than the words. Whoever had the power to create and to maintain such a court would waste his time pursuing freedom of the press; for then he would be absolute master of society itself and would be able to rid himself of writers and their writings at the same time. In the matter of the press, therefore, there is really not a middle ground between servitude and license. To reap the inestimable advantages that freedom of the press assures, you must know how to submit to the inevitable evils that it produces. Wanting to gain the first while escaping from the second is to give yourself over to one of these illusions that usually delude sick nations when, tired by struggles and exhausted by efforts, they seek the means to allow hostile opinions and opposite principles to coexist at the same time on the same soil.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2026">The little power of newspapers in America is due to several causes; here are the principal ones:</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2027">The freedom to write, like all other freedoms, is that much more to be feared, the newer it is. A people who has never heard the affairs of State treated in front of it believes the first popular orator who appears. Among the Anglo-Americans, this liberty is as old as the founding of the colonies. Moreover, the press, which knows so well how to inflame human passions, cannot create those passions by itself. [{What feeds freedom of the press, what gives it a hold on human will are political passions.}] Now, in America, political life is active, varied, even agitated, but it is rarely troubled by profound passions; rarely do the latter arise when material interests are not jeopardized, and in the United States these interests prosper. To judge the difference that exists on this point between the Anglo-Americans and us, I have only to glance at the newspapers of the two peoples. In France, the commercial advertisements occupy a very limited space; even the news items are few; the vital part of a newspaper is where the political discussions are found. In America, three quarters of the immense newspaper put before your eyes are filled by advertisements; the rest is usually occupied by political news or simple stories; only now and then, in an obscure corner, do you notice one <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>295<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of those heated discussions that among us are the daily food of the reader.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2028">Every power augments the action of its forces as their control is centralized; that is a general law of nature that examination demonstrates to the observer and that an even more certain instinct has always shown to the least of despots.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2029">In France, the press combines two distinct types of centralization. Nearly all of its power is concentrated in the same place and, so to speak, in the same hands, for the organs of the press are very few in number.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2030">Constituted in this way, in the middle of a skeptical nation, the power of the press is necessarily almost without limit. It is an enemy with which a government can reach a shorter or longer truce; but it is difficult for a government to live in confrontation with the press for long.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2031">Neither one nor the other of the two types of centralization that I have just spoken about exists in America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2032">The United States has no capital.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt866" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt866_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a> [≠In America the press is even less centralized than the government it attacks.≠] Enlightenment, like power, is disseminated in all the parts of this vast country. There, the beams of human intelligence, instead of coming from a common center, cut across each other in all directions; the Americans have placed the general direction of thought nowhere, any more than they have that of public affairs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2033">That is due to local circumstances that do not depend on men. But here are the ones that come from the laws:</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2034">In the United States, there are no licenses for printers, no stamps or registration for newspapers; the rule of surety bonds is unknown.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2035">As a result, the creation of a newspaper is a simple and easy undertaking; a few<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt867" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt867_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> subscribers suffice for the journalist to cover his expenses. The <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>296<span class="bracket">]</span></span> number of periodical or semi-periodical writings in the United States therefore surpasses all belief. The most enlightened Americans attribute the little power of the press to this incredible scattering of its forces. It is an axiom of political science in the United States that the only means to neutralize the effects of newspapers is to multiply their number. I cannot imagine that a truth so obvious has not yet become more common among us. I understand without difficulty that those who want to make revolutions with the aid of the press try to give it only a few powerful organs; but what I absolutely cannot conceive is that the official partisans of the established order and the natural supporters of existing laws believe that, by concentrating the press, its action can be attenuated. The governments of Europe seem to me to act toward the press in the same way that knights used to act toward their enemies. They had noticed from their own experience that centralization was a powerful weapon, and they wanted to provide it to their enemy, most probably to gain more glory in resisting him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2036">In the United States, there is hardly any small town without its newspaper. It can be easily understood that, among so many combatants, neither discipline nor unity of action can be established. Therefore each one raises his banner. Not that all the political newspapers of the Union are lined up for or against the administration; but they attack and defend it in a hundred different ways. So in the United States newspapers cannot establish those great waves of opinions that rise up or overwhelm the most powerful dikes. This division of the forces of the press produces still other no less remarkable effects. Because the creation of a newspaper is so easy, everyone can do it. On the other hand, competition means that a newspaper cannot hope for very great profits; this prevents great industrial talents from getting involved in enterprises of this type. Even if newspapers were a source of riches, they are so excessively numerous that there would not be enough talented writers to run them. So in general journalists in the United States do not have a very high [social] position; their education is only rudimentary; and the turn of their ideas is often vulgar. Now, in all things the majority makes the law; it establishes certain behaviors to which each person then conforms. The ensemble of these common habits <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>297<span class="bracket">]</span></span> is called a spirit;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt868" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt868_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a> there is the spirit of the bar, the spirit of the court. The spirit of the journalist, in France, is to discuss in a violent, but elevated and often eloquent way, the great interests of the State; if this is not always so, it is because every rule has its exceptions. The spirit of the journalist, in America, is to attack in a coarse way, unaffectedly and without art, the passions of those whom he addresses, to leave principles behind in order to grab men, to follow men in their private life, and to lay bare their weaknesses and their vices [treat the secrets of the domestic hearth and the honor of the marital bed].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2037">Such an abuse of thought must be deplored. Later I will have the opportunity to inquire into what influence newspapers have on the taste and morality of the American people; but I repeat that at the moment I am only dealing with the political world. You cannot hide from the fact that the political effects of this license of the press contribute indirectly to the maintenance of public tranquillity. The result is that men who already have an elevated position in the opinion of their fellow citizens do not dare to write in the newspapers; and they thereby lose the most formidable weapon that they could use to stir popular passion to their profit.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt869" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt869_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> The result is, above all, that the personal views expressed by journalists have no weight, so to speak, in the eyes of readers. What readers seek in a newspaper is knowledge of facts; only by altering or misrepresenting these facts can a journalist gain some influence for his opinion.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2038">Reduced to these resources alone, the press still exercises an immense power in America. It makes political life circulate in all parts of this vast territory. Always watchful, the press constantly lays bare the secret <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>298<span class="bracket">]</span></span> motivating forces of politics and compels public men, one by one, to appear before the court of opinion. It rallies interests around certain doctrines and formulates the creed of parties. Through the press, interests speak together without seeing each other, agree without having contact. When a large number of the organs of the press manage to follow the same path, their influence eventually becomes nearly irresistible; and public opinion, always struck from the same side, ends by yielding to their blows.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2039">In the United States, each newspaper individually has little power; but the periodical press, after the people, is still the first of powers.<a href="#n015" id="n015_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">A</a></p>
<div id="lf1593-01_div_086" class="type-section">
<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_086">That the Opinions Established under the Dominion of Freedom of the Press in the United States Are Often More Tenacious Than Those That Are Found Elsewhere under the Dominion of Censorship.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt870" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt870_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2040">In the United States, democracy constantly leads new men to the leadership of public affairs; so the government has little coherence and order in its measures. But the general principles of government there are more stable than in many other countries, and the principal opinions that rule society are more lasting. When an idea, whether sound or unreasonable, takes hold of the mind of the American people, nothing is more difficult than to eradicate it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2041">The same fact has been observed in England, the European country in which, for a century, the greatest freedom of thought and the most invincible prejudices have been seen.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2042">I attribute this effect to the very cause that, at first view, should seemingly prevent it, freedom of the press. Peoples among whom this freedom exists are attached to their opinions by pride as much as by conviction. They love them because they seem sound to them, and also because they have chosen <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>299<span class="bracket">]</span></span> them. And they hold them not only as something true, but also as something of their own.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2043">There are still several other reasons.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2044">A great man has said that <span class="ital">ignorance is at the two ends of knowledge.</span><a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt871" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt871_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a> Perhaps it would have been more true to say that deep convictions are found only at the two ends, and that doubt is in the middle. In fact, you can consider human intelligence in three distinct and often successive states.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2045">A man strongly believes, because he adopts a belief without going deeper. When objections appear, he doubts. Often he succeeds in resolving all these doubts; and then he begins to believe again. This time, he no longer grasps truth haphazardly and in the shadows; but he faces it and walks directly toward its light.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt872" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt872_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2046">When freedom of the press finds men in the first state, it leaves them for yet a long time with this habit of believing strongly without reflection; only it changes the object of their unthinking beliefs each day. So, over the whole intellectual horizon, the mind of man continues to see only one point at a time; but this point is constantly changing. This is the time of sudden revolutions. Woe to the generations that are the first suddenly to allow freedom of the press!</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2047">Soon, however, the circle of new ideas is nearly covered. Experience arrives, and man is plunged into doubt and a universal distrust.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2048">You can be assured that the majority of men will always stop at one of these two states. The majority will believe without knowing why, or will not know exactly what should be believed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2049">As for the other type of thoughtful and self-confident conviction that is born out of knowledge and arises from the very midst of the agitations of doubt, it will never be granted except in response to the efforts made by a very small number of men to attain it.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>300<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2050">Now, it has been observed that, in centuries of religious fervor, men sometimes changed belief; while in centuries of doubt, each one stubbornly kept his belief. This is how things happen in politics, under the rule of freedom of the press. Since all social theories, one by one, have been contested and fought, those who are attached to one of them keep it, not so much because they are sure that it is good, as because they are not sure that there is a better one.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2051">In these centuries, you do not risk death as easily for your opinions; but you do not change them. And, at the very same time, fewer martyrs and fewer apostates are found.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2052">To this reason, add another still more powerful. When opinions are doubted, men end up being attached solely to instincts and to material interests, which are much more visible, more tangible and more permanent by their nature than opinions are.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2053">To know whether democracy or aristocracy governs better is a very difficult question to decide. But clearly democracy hinders one man and aristocracy oppresses another.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt873" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt873_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2054">That is a self-evident truth; there is no need to discuss it; you are rich and I am poor.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2055">[≠When, as often happens, freedom of the press is combined with sovereignty of the people, the majority is sometimes seen to decide clearly in favor of an opinion. Then, the opposite opinion no longer has a way to be heard; those who share it fall silent, while their adversaries triumph out loud.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2056">Suddenly there is an unimaginable silence of which we Europeans can have no idea. Certain thoughts seem suddenly to disappear from the memory of men. Then freedom of the press exists in name, but in fact censorship <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>301<span class="bracket">]</span></span> reigns, a censorship a thousand times more powerful than that exercised by power./</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2057"><span class="ital">Note.</span> I know of no country where freedom of the press exists less than in America on certain questions. There are few despotic countries where censorship does not concern the form rather than the substance of thought. But in America there are subjects that cannot be touched upon in any way≠].</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2059">Of all the countries in the world, America has taken greatest advantage of association and has applied this powerful means of action<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt874" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt874_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a> to the greatest variety of objectives.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2060">Apart from permanent associations created by the law, known as towns, cities and counties, a multitude of others owe their birth and development only to individual wills.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2061">The inhabitant of the United States learns from birth that he must depend on himself in the struggle against the ills and difficulties of life; he looks upon social authority only with a defiant and uneasy eye, and calls upon its power only when he cannot do without it. This begins to be noticed as early as school where children, even in their games, submit to their <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>303<span class="bracket">]</span></span> own rules and punish their own infractions.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt875" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt875_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> The same spirit is found in all the actions of social life. An obstruction occurs on the public road; the way is interrupted; traffic stops; the neighbors soon get together as a deliberative body; out of this improvised assembly will come an executive power that will remedy the difficulty, before the idea of an authority pre-dating that of those interested has occurred to anyone’s imagination. If it is a matter of pleasure, the Americans will associate to give more splendor and order to the festival. Lastly, they unite to resist entirely intellectual enemies: together they fight intemperance. In the United States, they associate for purposes of public security, commerce and industry, [pleasure], morality and religion. There is nothing that human will despairs of achieving by the free action of the collective power of individuals.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2062">Later I will have the opportunity to speak about the effects that association produces in civil life.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt876" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt876_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> At the moment, I must stay within the political world.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2063">[≠After the press, association is the great means that parties use to get into public affairs and to gain the majority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2064">In America the freedom of association for political ends is unlimited. The freedom of assembly in order to discuss together the views of the association is equally unlimited.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2065">Once the right of association is recognized, citizens can use it in different ways.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2066">An association consists only of the public support that a certain number of individuals give to such and such doctrines and of the promise that they make to work in a particular way toward making those doctrines prevail. Thus the right to associate almost merges with freedom to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>304<span class="bracket">]</span></span> write;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt877" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt877_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> but the association already has more power than the press. When an opinion is represented by an association, it is forced to take a clearer and more precise form. It counts its partisans and involves them in its cause. The latter learn to know each other, and their ardor increases with their number. The association gathers the efforts of divergent minds into a network and vigorously pushes them toward a single, clearly indicated goal [&lt;even if it did not provide material means of action, its moral force would still be very formidable&gt;].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2067">The second level in the exercise of the right of association is the power to assemble. When a political association is allowed to locate centers of action at certain important points of the country, its activity becomes greater and its influence more extensive. There, men see each other; the means of action combine; opinions are expressed with the force and heat that written thought can never attain.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2068">Finally, in the exercise of the right of association in political matters, there is a last level. The partisans of the same opinion can meet in electoral colleges and name representatives to go to represent them in a central assembly. Strictly speaking, this is the representative system applied to a party.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2069">So, in the first case, men who profess the same opinion establish a purely intellectual bond among themselves; in the second, they meet in small assemblies that represent only a fraction of the party; finally, in the third, they form, so to speak, a separate nation within the nation, a government within the government.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt878" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt878_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> Their representatives, similar to the representatives of the majority, represent in themselves alone the whole collective force of their partisans; just like the representatives of the majority, they arrive with an <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>305<span class="bracket">]</span></span> appearance of nationhood and all the moral power that results from that. It is true that, unlike the representatives of the majority, they do not have the right to make laws; but they have the power to attack the laws that exist and to formulate in advance those that should exist.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2070">I assume a people who is not perfectly used to the practice of liberty or among whom deep political passions are stirring. Alongside the majority that makes the laws, I put a minority that only attends to <span class="ital">preambles</span> and stops at <span class="ital">plans of action;</span> and I cannot keep myself from believing that public order is exposed to great hazards [&lt;≠for man is made in such a way that, in his mind, there is only a step, the easiest of all to take, between proving that something is good and doing it.≠&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2071">Between proving that one law is better in itself than another, and proving that it must be substituted for the other, there is certainly a great distance. But where the minds of enlightened men see a great distance remaining, the imagination of the crowd no longer sees any. There are times, moreover, when the nation is almost equally divided between two parties, each claiming to represent the majority. If, next to the governing power, a power arises whose moral authority is almost as great, can we believe that it will limit itself for long to speaking without acting?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2072">Will it always stop before the metaphysical consideration that the purpose of associations is to lead opinions and not to force them, to recommend law and not to make it?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2073">The more I contemplate the principal effects of the independence of the press, the more I am convinced that among modern peoples independence of the press is the capital and, so to speak, the constituent element of liberty. So a people who wants to remain free has the right to require that the independence of the press be respected at all cost. But the <span class="ital">unlimited</span> freedom of association in political matters cannot be completely confused with the freedom to write. The first is both less necessary and more dangerous than the second. A nation can set limits on the first without losing control over itself; sometimes it must set limits in order to continue to be in control.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2074">In America, the freedom of association for political ends is unlimited.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2075">An example will show, better than all I could add, the degree to which it is tolerated.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>306<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2076">You recall how the question of the tariff or free trade has stirred minds up in America. The tariff favored or attacked not only opinions, but also very powerful material interests. The North attributed a portion of its prosperity to the tariff; the South, nearly all of its misfortunes. It can be said that, for a long time, the only political passions that have agitated the Union have arisen from the tariff.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2077">In 1831, when the quarrel was most bitter, an obscure citizen of Massachusetts thought to propose, in the newspapers, that all the enemies of the tariff send deputies to Philadelphia, in order to consult together about the ways to reestablish free trade. In a few days, the proposal circulated from Maine to New Orleans due to the power of the printed word. The enemies of the tariff adopted it ardently. They met everywhere and named deputies. Most of these were men who were known, and some of them were famous. South Carolina, seen afterward to take up arms in the same cause, sent sixty-three delegates on its behalf. The first of October 1831, the assembly, which, following the American habit, had taken the name “convention,” formed in Philadelphia; it numbered more than two hundred members. The discussions were public and, from the first day, took on an entirely legislative character. The deputies examined the extent of congressional powers, the theories of free trade, and finally the various provisions of the tariff. At the end of ten days, the assembly dispersed after having drafted an address to the American people. This address stated: 1. that Congress did not have the right to pass a tariff and that the existing tariff was unconstitutional; 2. that the lack of free trade was not in the interest of any people, and particularly not the American people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2078">It must be recognized that, until now, unlimited freedom of association in political matters has not produced, in the United States, the harmful results that could perhaps be expected elsewhere. There, the right of association is an English import, and it has existed in America since the beginning. Today, the use of this right has passed into the habits and into the mores. [{perhaps today it has even become a necessary guarantee against parliamentary tyranny as well}].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2079">In our time, freedom of association has become a necessary<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt879" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt879_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> guarantee <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>307<span class="bracket">]</span></span> against the tyranny of the majority.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt880" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt880_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a> In the United States, once a party has become dominant, all public power passes into its hands; its particular friends hold all posts and have the use of all organized forces. Not able to break through the barrier that separates them from power, the most distinguished men of the opposite party must be able to establish themselves outside of it; with its whole moral strength, the minority must resist the material power that oppresses it. So one danger is set against another more to be feared.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2080">The omnipotence of the majority appears to me to be such a great peril for the American republics that the dangerous means used to limit it still seem good to me.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2081">Here I will express a thought that will recall what I said elsewhere about town liberties. There are no countries where associations are more necessary, to prevent the despotism of parties or the arbitrariness of the prince, than those where the social state is democratic. Among aristocratic nations, secondary bodies form natural associations that stop the abuses of power.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt881" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt881_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a> In countries where such associations do not exist, if individuals cannot artificially and temporarily create something that resembles those natural associations, I no longer see any dike against any sort of tyranny; and a great people can be oppressed with impunity by a factious handful of individuals or by a man.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2082">[≠There is a cause that is hardly suspected and that, in my view, renders political associations less dangerous in America than elsewhere; it is universal <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>308<span class="bracket">]</span></span> suffrage. In Europe, associations act in two ways: by the material strength that their organization brings to them, or by the moral power given to them by the support of the majority that they always claim to represent. In the United States this last element of strength is lacking. In countries where universal suffrage is allowed, there is never a doubtful majority, because no party can establish itself as the representative of those who did not vote.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2083">Thus, in America, associations can never pretend to represent the majority; they only aim to convince it. They do not want to act, but to persuade; in that, above all, they are different from the political associations of Europe.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2084">The meeting of a great political convention (for there are conventions of all types) can often become a necessary measure. Even in America, such a meeting is a serious event, one that the friends of their country can only contemplate with fear.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2085">This was seen very clearly in the convention of 1831, where all the efforts of the distinguished men who were part of the assembly tended to moderate its language and to limit its objectives. Probably, the convention of 1831 exercised, in fact, a great influence on the mind of the discontented and prepared them for the open revolt that took place in 1832 against the commercial laws of the Union.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2086">You cannot conceal the fact that, of all liberties, the unlimited freedom of association, in political matters, is the last one that a people can bear.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt882" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt882_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a> If unlimited freedom of association does not make a people fall into anarchy, it puts a people on the brink, so to speak, at every moment. This <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>309<span class="bracket">]</span></span> liberty, so dangerous, offers guarantees on one point, however; in countries where associations are free, secret societies are unknown. In America, there are agitators, but not conspirators.</p>
<div id="lf1593-01_div_088" class="type-section">
<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_088">Different Ways in Which the Right of Association Is Understood in Europe and in the United States, and the Different Use That Is Made of That Right</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2087">After the liberty of acting alone, the liberty most natural to man is to combine his efforts with the efforts of his fellows and to act in common. So to me, the right of association seems almost as inalienable by nature as individual liberty. The legislator would not want to destroy it without attacking society itself. But if there are some peoples among whom the liberty to unite together is only beneficial and fruitful in prosperity, there are also others who, by their excesses, distort it and turn an element of life into a cause of destruction. It seemed to me that a comparison of the different paths that associations follow, in countries where the liberty is understood and in those where this liberty turns into license, would be useful both to governments and to parties.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2088">Most Europeans still see the association as a weapon that is hastily made to try out immediately on the field of battle.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2089">They join together for the purpose of talking, but the next thought, that of acting, preoccupies all minds. An association is an army; they talk in order to take stock and to come to life; and then they march on the enemy. In the eyes of those who compose the association, legal resources can appear to be means, but they are never the only means of success.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2090">That is not the way the right of association is understood in the United States. In America, citizens who form the minority join together, first, to determine their number and, in this way, to weaken the moral dominion of the majority; the second objective of those associated is to test and, in this way, to discover the arguments most suitable for making an impression on the majority; for they always hope to attract the majority and then, in its name, to have the use of power. [≠So in America, the purpose of associations is to convince and not to compel.≠]</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>310<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2091">Political associations in the United States therefore are peaceful in their objective and legal in their means; and when they claim to want to triumph only through law they are, in general, speaking the truth.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2092">On this point the noticeable difference between the Americans and us is due to several causes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2093">In Europe parties exist that differ so much from the majority that they can never hope to gain their support; and these very parties believe they are strong enough by themselves to struggle against the majority. When a party of this type forms an association, it does not want to convince, but to fight. In America, men<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt883" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt883_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> who are so removed from the majority by their opinion can do nothing against the power of the majority; all others hope to win it over.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2094">So the exercise of the right of association becomes dangerous in proportion to how impossible it is for great parties to become the majority. In a country like the United States, where opinions differ only by nuances, the right of association can, so to speak, remain unlimited.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2095">What still leads us to see, in freedom of association, only the right to make war against those governing, is our inexperience in liberty. When a party gains strength, the first idea that comes to its mind, as to that of a man, is the idea of violence. The idea of persuasion only comes later; it arises from experience.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2096">The English, who are divided among themselves in so profound a way, rarely abuse the right of association, because they have used it longer.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2097">In addition, among us, such a passionate taste for war exists that no undertaking, however insane, even if it must turn the State upside down, lacks adherents who see themselves as glorious for dying on the field of battle.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2098">But of all the causes in the United States that work together to moderate the violence of political association, perhaps the most powerful is universal suffrage. In countries where universal suffrage is accepted, the majority is never in doubt, because no party can reasonably set itself up as the representative of those who have not voted. So the associations know, and everyone knows, that they do not represent the majority. This results from <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>311<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the very fact of their existence; for, if they represented the majority, they would change the law themselves instead of asking for its reform.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2099">The moral force of the government they are attacking is greatly increased; theirs, much weakened.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2100">In Europe, there is hardly any association that does not claim to represent or believe it represents the will of the majority. This claim or this belief prodigiously increases their strength, and serves marvelously to legitimate their actions. For what is more excusable than violence in order to gain victory for the oppressed cause of right?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2101">Thus, in the immense complication of human laws, sometimes extreme liberty corrects the abuses of liberty, and extreme democracy prevents the dangers of democracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2102">In Europe, associations consider themselves, in a way, the legislative and executive council of the nation that cannot speak for itself; starting from this idea, they act and command. In America, where, in everyone’s eyes, associations represent only a minority of the nation, they talk and petition.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2103">The means used by associations in Europe agree with the end that they propose.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2104">Since the principal end of these associations is to act and not to talk, to fight and not to persuade, they are led naturally to adopt an organization that is not at all civil and to introduce military habits and maxims. Thus you can see them centralize the control of their forces, as much as possible, and deliver the power of all into the hands of a very small number of men.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt884" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt884_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2105">The members of these associations respond to an order like soldiers at war; they profess the dogma of passive obedience, or rather, by uniting together, they have at one stroke made the complete sacrifice of their judgment and free will. Thus, within these associations, a tyranny often reigns that is more unbearable than the one exercised within the society in the name of the government that is attacked.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2106">This greatly diminishes their moral force. In this way, they lose the sacred <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>312<span class="bracket">]</span></span> character attached to the struggle of the oppressed against the oppressors. For how can he who, in certain circumstances, consents to obey slavishly a few of his fellows, to surrender his will to them and to submit even his thoughts to them, how can that man possibly claim that he wants to be free?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2107">The Americans have also established a government within associations. But, if I can express myself in this way, it is a civil government. Individual independence plays a role. As in society, all men there march at the same time toward the same end. But no one is forced to march exactly in the same path. No one sacrifices his will and his reason; but his will and his reason are applied to making the common enterprise succeed.</p>

<h2 id="lf1593-01_label_1006">CHAPTER 5: <span class="ital">Of the Government of Democracy in America</span></h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2108">I know that I am walking here on fiery ground. Each of the words of this chapter must in some respects offend the different parties dividing my country. I will, nonetheless, express my whole thought.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2109">In Europe, we have difficulty judging the true character and permanent instincts of democracy, because in Europe there is a struggle between two opposite principles. And we do not know precisely what should be attributed to the principles themselves or to the passions that the conflict has produced.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2110">It is not the same in America. There, the people dominate without obstacles; there are no dangers to fear or wrongs to revenge.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2111">So, in America, democracy is given over to its own inclinations. Its pace is natural, and all its movements are free. That is where it must be judged. And for whom would this study be interesting and profitable, if not for us, who are dragged along each day by an irresistible movement and who march blindly, perhaps toward despotism, perhaps toward the republic, but definitely toward a democratic social state?</p>

<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_090">Of Universal Suffrage</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2112">I said previously that all the states of the Union had allowed universal suffrage. It is also found among populations situated at different levels of [{civilization}] the social scale. I have had the opportunity to see its effects in various places and among races of men made nearly strangers to each other by their language, their religion, or their mores, in Louisiana as in New England, in Georgia as in Canada. I noted that, in America, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>314<span class="bracket">]</span></span> universal suffrage was far from producing all the good and all the evil that are expected in Europe, and that, in general, its effects were other than those supposed.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt885" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt885_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2114">Many people in Europe believe without saying, or say without believing, that one of the great advantages of universal suffrage is to call men worthy of public confidence to the leadership of public affairs.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt886" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt886_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> It is said that a people cannot govern itself, but always sincerely wants the good of the State, and its instinct hardly ever fails to point out those who are animated by the same desire and who are most capable of holding power.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt887" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt887_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2115">I must say that, for me, what I saw in America does not authorize me to think that this is so. Upon my arrival in the United States, I was struck <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>315<span class="bracket">]</span></span> with surprise to find out how common merit was among the governed and how uncommon it was among those governing.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt888" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt888_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> Today it is a constant fact in the United States that the most outstanding men are rarely called to public office, and we are forced to recognize that this has occurred as democracy has gone beyond all its former limits. Clearly the race of American statesmen has grown singularly smaller over the past half century.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2116">Several causes of this phenomenon can be indicated.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2117">It is impossible, no matter what you do, to raise the enlightenment of the people above a certain level. Whatever you do to make human learning more accessible, improve the methods of instruction and make knowledge more affordable, you will never be able to have men learn and develop their intelligence without devoting time to the task.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2118">So the greater or lesser facility that the people have for living without working sets the necessary limit to their intellectual progress. This limit is further away in certain countries, closer in certain others; but for there to be no limit, it would be necessary for the people not to have to be occupied with the material cares of life; that is, for them no longer to be the people.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt889" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt889_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> So it is as difficult to imagine a society in which all men are very enlightened, as a State in which all citizens are rich; these are two correlative difficulties. I will admit without difficulty that the mass of citizens very sincerely wants the country’s good. I go even further, and I say that, in general, the lower classes of society seem to me to mingle fewer calculations of personal interest with this desire than do the upper classes; but what they always more or less lack is the art of judging the means while sincerely desiring the end. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>316<span class="bracket">]</span></span> What long study, what diverse notions are necessary to get an exact idea of the character of a single man! There the greatest geniuses go astray, and the multitude would succeed! The people never find the time and the means to give themselves to this work. They must always judge in haste and attach themselves to the most salient objects. As a result, charlatans of all types know very well the secret of pleasing the people, while their true friends most often fail. [&lt;In most of the states of the Union I saw positions occupied by men who had succeeded in gaining them only by flattering the slightest passions and bowing before the smallest caprices of the people.&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2119">Moreover, it is not always the capacity to choose men of merit that democracy lacks, but the desire and the taste.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2120">The fact must not be concealed that democratic institutions develop the sentiment of envy in the human heart to a very high degree, not so much because they offer each person the means to become equal to others, but because these means constantly fail those who use them. Democratic institutions awaken and flatter the passion for equality without ever being able to satisfy it entirely. Every day, at the moment when people believe they have grasped complete equality, it escapes from their hands and flees, as Pascal says,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt890" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt890_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> in an eternal flight. People become heated in search of this good, all the more precious since it is close enough to be known, but far enough away not to be savored. The chance to succeed rouses the people; the uncertainty of success irritates them. They get agitated, grow weary, become embittered. Then, everything that is in some way beyond them seems an obstacle to their desires, and there is no superiority, however legitimate, that they do not grow tired of seeing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2121">Many people imagine among us that the secret instinct that leads the lower classes to keep the upper classes away from the leadership of public affairs as much as they can is found only in France. That is an error: the instinct that I am speaking about is not French, it is democratic. Political circumstances have been able to give it a particular character of bitterness, but they did not give birth to it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2122">In the United States, the people have no hatred for the upper classes of society; but they feel little goodwill toward them and carefully keep them <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>317<span class="bracket">]</span></span> out of power; they do not fear great talents, but they appreciate them little.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt891" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt891_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a> In general, you notice that everything that arises without their support gains their favor with difficulty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2123">While the natural instincts of democracy lead the people to keep distinguished men away from power, an instinct no less strong leads the latter to remove themselves from a political career in which it is so difficult for them to remain entirely themselves, and to operate without debasing themselves. This thought is very ingenuously expressed by Chancellor Kent. The celebrated author about whom I am speaking, after giving great praise to the part of the Constitution that grants the nomination of judges to the executive power, adds: “The fittest men would probably have too much reservedness of manners, and severity of morals, to secure an election <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>318<span class="bracket">]</span></span> resting on universal suffrage” (<span class="ital">Kent’s Commentaries,</span> vol. I, p. 272[273 (ed.)].) This was published without contradiction in America in the year 1830.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2124">This demonstrated to me that those who regard universal suffrage as a guarantee for good choices are under a complete illusion. Universal suffrage has other advantages, but not that one.</p>

<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_092">Of the Causes That Can Partially Correct These Democratic Instincts</h2>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2126">When great perils threaten the State, you often see people happily choose the citizens most appropriate to save them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2127">It has been remarked that, in pressing danger, man rarely remains at his usual level; he rises well above, or falls below. The same thing happens to peoples themselves. Extreme perils, instead of elevating a nation, sometimes finish demoralizing it; they arouse its passions without guiding them; and, far from enlightening its mind, they trouble it. The Jews still slit their own throats amid the smoking ruins of the Temple. But, among nations as among men, it is more common to see extraordinary virtues arise from very present dangers. Then great characters appear like those monuments, hidden by the darkness of night, that suddenly stand out against the glow of a fire. Genius is no longer averse to reappearing on its own, and the people, struck by their own dangers, temporarily forget their envious passions. Then, it is not uncommon to see celebrated names emerge from the electoral urn. I said above that in America the statesmen <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>319<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of today seem<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt892" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt892_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a> greatly inferior to those who appeared at the head of public affairs fifty years ago. This is due not only to laws, but also to circumstances. When America fought for the most just of causes, that of one people escaping from the yoke of another people; when it was a matter of having a new nation emerge in the world, all souls rose to reach the lofty goal of their efforts. In this general excitement, superior men courted the people and the people, embracing them, placed them at their head. But such events are rare; judgment must be based on the ordinary course of things.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2128">If temporary events sometimes succeed in combating the passions of democracy, enlightenment and, above all, mores exercise a no less powerful and more enduring influence on its inclinations. This is clearly noticed in the United States.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2129">In New England, where education and liberty are the daughters of morality and religion, where society, already old and long settled, has been able to form maxims and habits, the people, while escaping from all the superiorities that wealth and birth have ever created among men, have become used to respecting and submitting to intellectual and moral superiorities without displeasure; consequently, you see democracy in New England make better choices than anywhere else.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2130">In contrast, as you descend toward the south, in the states where the social bond is less ancient and less powerful, where instruction is less widespread, and where the principles of morality, religion, and liberty are less happily combined, you notice that talents and virtues become more and more rare among those governing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2131">When, finally, you enter the new states of the Southwest, where the social body, formed yesterday, still presents only an agglomeration of adventurers or speculators, you are astounded to see what hands hold the public power, and you wonder by what force independent of legislation and men the State can grow and society prosper there.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>320<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2132">There are certain laws of a democratic nature, however, that succeed in partially correcting these dangerous democratic instincts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2133">When you enter the House chamber in Washington, you feel struck by the vulgar aspect of the great assembly. Often your eye searches in vain for a celebrated man within the assembly. Nearly all its members are obscure persons, whose names bring no image to mind. They are, for the most part, village lawyers, tradesmen, or even men belonging to the lowest classes. In a country where instruction is nearly universal, it is said that the representatives of the people do not always know how to write correctly.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt893" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt893_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2134">[&lt;If they speak, their language is usually without dignity and the ideas they express are devoid of scope and loftiness.&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2135">Two steps from there opens the Senate chamber, whose narrow enclosure contains a large portion of the famous men of America. You notice hardly a single man there who does not evoke the idea of recent celebrity. They are eloquent lawyers, distinguished generals, skilled magistrates, or known statesmen. All the words that issue from this [august] assembly would do honor to the greatest parliamentary debates of Europe.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2136">What causes this bizarre contrast? Why is the nation’s elite found in this chamber rather than in the other? Why does the first assembly gather so many vulgar elements, while the second seems to have a monopoly of talents and enlightenment? Both come from the people, however; both are <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>321<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the result of universal suffrage, and, until now, no voice has been raised in America to maintain that the Senate might be the enemy of popular interests. So what causes such an enormous difference? I see only a single fact that explains it. The election that produces the House of Representatives is direct; the one producing the Senate is subject to two stages. The universality of citizens names the legislature of each state, and the federal Constitution, transforming each of these legislatures into electoral bodies, draws from them the members of the Senate. So the Senators express the result of universal suffrage, though indirectly. For the legislature, which names the Senators, is not an aristocratic or privileged body that derives its electoral right from itself; it is essentially dependent on the universality of citizens. In general it is elected by them annually, and they can always direct its choices by remaking it with new members. But it is sufficient for the popular will to pass through this chosen assembly in order, in a sense, to be transformed and to emerge clothed in more noble and more beautiful forms. So the men elected in this way always represent exactly the governing majority of the nation; but they represent only the elevated thoughts that circulate in its midst, the generous instincts that animate it, and not the small passions that often trouble it and the vices that dishonor it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2137">It is easy to see a moment in the future when the American republics will be forced to multiply the use of two stages in their electoral system, under pain of getting miserably lost among the pitfalls of democracy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt894" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt894_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2138">I will have no difficulty in admitting it; I see in indirect election the only means to put the use of political liberty within reach of all classes of the people. Those who hope to make this means the exclusive weapon of one party, and those who fear this means, seem to me to be equally in error.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2143">Thus, on the one hand, there is a chance of uneasiness for the State; on the other, a chance of revolution; the first system harms the goodness of government, the second threatens its existence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2144">The Americans have preferred to expose themselves to the first evil rather than to the second. In that, they have been guided by instinct much more than by reasoning, since democracy drives the taste for variety to a passion. The result is a singular mutability in legislation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2145">Many Americans consider the instability of the laws as a necessary consequence of a system whose general effects are useful.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt897" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt897_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a> But there is no one <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>323<span class="bracket">]</span></span> in the United States, I believe, who pretends to deny that this instability exists or who does not regard it as a great evil.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2146">Hamilton, after having demonstrated the utility of a power that could prevent or at least slow the promulgation of bad laws, adds: “It may perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws includes that of preventing good ones. … But this objection will have little weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that inconstancy and mutability in the laws, which <span class="ital">form the greatest blemish in the character and genius of our governments”</span> (<span class="ital">Federalist,</span> No. 73.)<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt898" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt898_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2149">The instability of our laws is really a very serious disadvantage, he says. I think that we will have to deal with that by deciding that there would always be an interval of a year between the proposal of a law and the definitive vote. It would then be discussed and voted, without being able to change a word, and if circumstances seemed to require a more prompt resolution, the proposed law could not be adopted by a simple majority, but by a two-thirds majority of both houses.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt899" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt899_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>

<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_094">Of Public Officials under the Dominion of American Democracy</h2>
<div class="opener">
<div id="lf1593-01_argument_048" class="argument">
<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2150"><span class="ital">Simplicity of American officials.—Lack of official dress.—All officials are paid.—Political consequences of this fact.—In America, there is no public career.—What results from that.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2151">Public officials in the United States remain mixed within the crowd of citizens; they have neither palaces, nor guards, nor ceremonial dress [but they are all paid]. This simplicity of those who govern is due not only to a particular turn of the American spirit, but also to the fundamental principles of the society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2152">In the eyes of the democracy, government is not a good, but a necessary evil. A certain power must be accorded to officials; for, without this power, what purpose would they serve? But the external appearances of power are not indispensable to the course of public affairs; they needlessly offend the sight of the public.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2153">Officials themselves are perfectly aware that, by their power, they have not obtained the right to put themselves above others, except on the condition of descending, by their manners, to the level of all.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2154">I can imagine nothing plainer in his ways of acting, more accessible to all, more attentive to demands, and more civil in his responses, than a public figure in the United States.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2155">I like this natural look of the government of democracy;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt901" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt901_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a> in this internal <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>325<span class="bracket">]</span></span> strength that is attached more to the office than to the official, more to the man than to the external signs of power, I see something manly that I admire.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2156">As for the influence that official dress can exercise, I believe that the importance that it must have in a century such as ours is greatly exaggerated. I have not noticed that in America the official, by being reduced solely to his own merit, was greeted with less regard and respect in the exercise of his power.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt902" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt902_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2157">From another perspective, I strongly doubt that a particular garment leads public men to respect themselves when they are not naturally disposed to do so; for I cannot believe that they have more regard for their outfit than for their person.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2158">When, among us, I see certain magistrates treat parties brusquely or address them with false courtesy, shrug their shoulders at the means of defense and smile with complacency at the enumeration of charges, I would like someone to try to remove their robe, in order to discover if, finding themselves dressed as simple citizens, they would not be reminded of the natural dignity of the human species.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt903" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt903_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2159">No public official in the United States has an official dress, but all receive a salary.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt904" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt904_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2160">Still more naturally than what precedes, this follows from democratic principles. A democracy can surround its magistrates with pomp and cover them with silk and gold without directly attacking the principle of its existence. Such privileges are temporary; they are attached to the position, and not to the man. But to establish unpaid offices is to create a class of rich and independent officials, to form the kernel of an aristocracy. If the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>326<span class="bracket">]</span></span> people still retain the right to choose, the exercise of the right then has necessary limits.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2161">When you see a democratic republic make paid officials unsalaried, I believe that you can conclude that it is moving toward monarchy. And when a monarchy begins to pay unsalaried offices, it is the sure sign that you are advancing toward a despotic state or toward a republican state.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt905" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt905_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2162">So the substitution of salaried offices for unpaid offices seems to me to constitute, in itself alone, a true revolution.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2163">I regard the complete absence of unpaid offices as one of the most visible signs of the absolute dominion that democracy exercises in America. Services rendered to the public, whatever they may be, are paid there; moreover, each person has, not only the right, but also the possibility of rendering them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2164">If, in democratic States, all citizens can gain positions, not all are tempted to try to obtain them. It is not the conditions of candidacy, but the number and the capacity of the candidates that often limit the choice of the voters.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt906" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt906_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2165">For peoples among whom the principle of election extends to everything, there is no public career strictly speaking. In a way men reach offices only by chance, and they have no assurance of remaining there. That is true above all when elections are annual. As a result, in times of calm, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>327<span class="bracket">]</span></span> public offices offer little lure to ambition. In the United States, it is men of moderate desires who commit themselves to the twists and turns of politics. Great talents and great passions generally move away from power, in order to pursue wealth; and often someone takes charge of leading the fortune of the State only when he feels little capable of conducting his own affairs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2166">The great number of vulgar men who occupy public offices must be attributed to these causes as much as to the bad choices of democracy. In the United States, I do not know if the people would choose superior men who bid for their votes, but it is certain that the latter do not bid for them.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2168">There are two types of government in which a great deal of arbitrariness is joined with the action of magistrates; it is so under the absolute government of one man and under the government of democracy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt909" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt909_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>328<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2169">This same result comes from almost analogous causes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2170">In despotic States, no one’s fate is assured, not that of public officials any more than that of simple individuals. The sovereign, always holding in his hand the life, fortune and sometimes the honor of the men he employs, thinks that he has nothing to fear from them; and he leaves them great freedom of action, because he thinks he is assured that they will never use that freedom against him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2171">In despotic States, the sovereign is so in love with his power that he fears the constraint of his own rules; and he loves to see his agents go more or less haphazardly in order to be sure never to find among them a tendency contrary to his desires.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2172">Nor in democracies does the majority fear that power will be used against it, because every year it can remove power from the hands of those to whom power has been confided. Able at every moment to make its will known to those who govern, the majority prefers to abandon them to their own efforts rather than to bend them to an invariable rule that, by limiting those who govern, would in a sense limit the majority itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2173">You even discover, looking closely, that under the dominion of democracy, the arbitrariness of the magistrate must be still greater than in despotic States.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>329<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2174">In these States, the sovereign can punish in a moment all the misdeeds that he notices, but he cannot flatter himself that he notices all the misdeeds that he should punish. In democracies, on the contrary, the sovereign is simultaneously omnipotent and omnipresent. You see, therefore, that American officials are much freer within the circle of action that the law traces for them than any official in Europe. Often the Americans limit themselves to showing officials the end toward which they must aim, leaving them with the authority to choose the means.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2175">In New England, for example, the duty to draw up the jury list is referred to the <span class="ital">selectmen</span> of each town. The only rule that is stipulated is this: they must choose the jurors from among those citizens who enjoy the right to vote and who are of good reputation.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt910" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt910_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2176">In France, we would believe the lives and liberty of men at risk if we confided the exercise of so fearsome a right to an official, whoever he was.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2177">In New England, these same magistrates can have the names of drunkards posted in taverns and, by penalty of a fine, prevent the occupants from providing them with wine.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt911" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt911_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2178">Such a censorial power would outrage people in the most absolute monarchy; here, however, people submit without difficulty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2179">Nowhere has the law left a larger portion of arbitrariness than in democratic republics, because there does not seem to be any reason to fear arbitrariness. You can even say that, as the right to vote expands and as the term in office becomes more limited, the magistrate becomes freer.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>330<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2180">That is why it is so difficult to have a democratic republic become a monarchy. The magistrate, while ceasing to be elective, usually keeps the rights and preserves the customs of the elected magistrates. Then you arrive at despotism.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt912" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt912_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2181">Only in limited monarchies does the law, while drawing a circle of action around public officials, still take care at the same time to guide them at each step. The reason for this fact is easy to state.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2182">In limited monarchies, power is divided between the people and the prince. Both are interested in having the position of the magistrate stable.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2183">The prince does not want to put the fate of officials back into the hands of the people, for fear that the officials will betray his authority; on their side, the people are afraid that the magistrates, placed in absolute dependence on the prince, will help to crush liberty; so, in a way, the magistrates are made to depend on no one.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2184">The same reason that leads the prince and the people to make the official independent, leads them to seek guarantees against the abuse of his independence, so that he does not turn against the authority of the one or the liberty of the other. Both agree, therefore, on the need to trace in advance a line of conduct for the public official, and find it in their interest to impose rules on him that are impossible for him to evade.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2186">Men hold power only for an instant and then are lost in a crowd that, itself, changes face every day; as a result, the actions of society in America often leave less trace than the actions of a simple family.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt913" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt913_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a> Public administration there is, in a way, oral and traditional. Nothing is put in writing, or what is put in writing flies away with the slightest wind, like the leaves of the Sybil, and disappears forever.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2187">The only historical memorials of the United States are newspapers. If an issue happens to be missing, the chain of time is as if broken: present and past are no longer joined. I do not doubt that in fifty years it will be more difficult to gather authentic documents about the details of the social existence of the Americans of today, than about the administration of the French of the Middle Ages; and if an invasion of barbarians happened to surprise the United States, it would be necessary, in order to know something about the people who live there, to resort to the history of other nations.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2188">Administrative instability began by entering into habits; I could almost say that today each person has ended up by acquiring the taste for it. No one is worried about what was done before. No method is adopted; no collection is assembled; no documents are gathered, even when it would be easy to do so. When by chance someone has them in his possession, he hardly holds onto them. Among my papers, I have original pieces that were given to me in the offices of the public administration in order to answer some of my questions. In America, society seems to live from day to day, like an army in the field. Yet, the art of administration is definitely a science; <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>332<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and all sciences, to progress, need to link together the discoveries of different generations as they succeed each other. One man, in the short space of a life, notices a fact, another conceives an idea; this one invents a method, that one finds a formula; humanity gathers along the way these various fruits of individual experiences and forms the sciences. It is very difficult for American administrators to learn anything from one another. Therefore, they bring to the conduct of society the knowledge that they find widespread in society, but not the learning that is their own.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt914" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt914_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> So democracy, pushed to its extreme limits, harms progress in the art of governing.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt915" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt915_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> From this perspective, it is better suited to a people whose administrative education is already formed than to a people who are inexperienced novices in public affairs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2189">This, moreover, does not relate uniquely to administrative science.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt916" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt916_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> Democratic government, which is based upon such a simple and natural idea, always supposes the existence of a very civilized and learned society.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt917" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt917_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> At first you would think it contemporaneous with the earliest ages of the world; looking more closely, you easily discover that it could have come about only during the last.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt918" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt918_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2193">The question would be easy to resolve if we wanted to establish a parallel between a democratic republic and an absolute monarchy [v: despotic State]. We would find that public expenditures in the first are more considerable than in the second.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt919" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt919_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> But this is the case in all free States, compared to those that are not free. It is certain that despotism ruins men more by preventing them from being productive, than by taking the fruits of production from them; it dries up the source of wealth and often respects acquired wealth. Liberty, in contrast, gives birth to a thousand times more goods than it destroys, and, among nations that know liberty, the resources of the people always increase faster than taxes.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt920" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt920_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2194">What is important to me at this moment is to compare free peoples, and among the latter to note what influence democracy exercises on the finances of the State.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2195">Societies, just as organized bodies do, follow certain rules in their formation that they cannot evade. They are composed of certain elements that are found everywhere and in all times.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2196">It will always be easy to divide each people ideally into three classes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2197">The first class will be composed of the rich. The second will include those who, without being rich, live well-off in all things. The third will contain all those who have only few or no properties and who live particularly from the work provided to them by the first two classes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2198">The individuals included in these different categories can be more or less numerous, depending on the social state [added: and the laws]; but you cannot make these categories cease to exist.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2199">It is evident that each of these classes will bring its own distinctive instincts to the handling of the finances of the State.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2200">Suppose that the first makes the laws. Probably it will be little concerned with economizing public monies, because a tax that happens to strike a considerable fortune only takes what is superfluous and produces an effect that is little felt.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt921" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt921_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>335<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2201">Assume, on the contrary, that the middle classes alone make the law. You can count on the fact that they will not be lavish with taxes, because there is nothing so disastrous as a heavy tax that happens to strike a small<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt922" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt922_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a> fortune.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2202">It seems to me that, among free governments, the government of the middle classes must be,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt923" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt923_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> I will not say the most enlightened, nor, especially, the most generous, but the most economical.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt924" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt924_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2203">Now I suppose that the last class is exclusively charged with making the law; I clearly see the chance for public expenses to increase instead of decrease, and this for two reasons.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2204">Since the greatest portion of those who in that case vote the law have no taxable property, all the money expended in the interest of society seems to be only to their profit, never to their harm; and those who have some bit of property easily find the means to fix the tax so that it hits only the rich and profits only the poor, something that the rich cannot do in their case when they are in control of the government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2205">So countries in which the poor<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt925" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt925_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> would exclusively be charged with making <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>336<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the law could not hope for great economy in public expenditures; these expenditures will always be considerable, either because taxes cannot reach those who vote, or because they are fixed so as not to reach them. In other words, the government of democracy is the only one in which the one who votes the taxes can escape the obligation to pay them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2206">You will object in vain that the well understood interest of the people<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt927" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt927_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a> is to handle the fortune of the rich carefully, because it would not take long for the people to feel the effects of any difficulties caused. But isn’t it also the interest of kings to make their subjects happy, and that of the nobles to know how to open their ranks opportunely? If long-term interest could prevail over the passions and needs of the moment, there would never have been tyrannical sovereigns or exclusive aristocracies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2207">You will stop me here, saying: Who ever imagined charging the poor alone with making the law? Who! Those who have established universal suffrage. Is it the majority or the minority that makes the law? Undoubtedly the majority; and if I prove that the poor always make up the majority, won’t I be correct to add that in countries where the poor are called to vote, they alone make the law?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2208">Now, it is certain that until now, among all the nations of the world, the greatest number has always been composed of those who had no property, or of those whose property was too limited for them to be able to live comfortably without working. So universal suffrage really gives the government of society to the poor.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2209">The unfortunate influence that popular power can sometimes exercise over the finances of the State made itself clear in certain democratic republics of antiquity, in which the public treasury was exhausted to help indigent citizens, or to give games and spectacles to the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2210">It is true to say that the representative system was almost unknown in antiquity.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt928" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt928_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a> Today, popular passions arise with more difficulty in public affairs; you can, however, count on the fact that, in the long run, the delegate will always end by conforming to the spirit of his constituents and by making their propensities as well as their interests prevail.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2211">[This same tendency is even more noticeable in England with the poor tax, the only tax that is established by the people, that profits only them, and that has a democratic origin and object.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2212">The profusions of democracy are, moreover, less to be feared the more people become property owners, because then, on the one hand, the people have less need for the money of the rich and, on the other hand, they encounter more difficulties establishing a tax that does not hit them. From this perspective, universal suffrage would be less dangerous in France than in England, where nearly all taxable property is gathered in a few hands. America, where the great majority of citizens own property, is in a more favorable situation than France.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2213">Still other causes can raise the sum of public expenditures in democracies.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt929" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt929_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2214">When the aristocracy governs, the men who conduct State affairs escape all needs by their very position; content with their lot, they ask above all <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>338<span class="bracket">]</span></span> for power and glory from society; and, placed above the anonymous crowd of citizens, they do not always see clearly how the general welfare necessarily works toward their own grandeur. It is not that they see the sufferings of the poor without pity; but they cannot feel the miseries of the poor as though they shared them themselves. As long as the people seem to be content with their own fortune, these men consider themselves satisfied and expect nothing more from the government. Aristocracy thinks more about maintaining than improving.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt930" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt930_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2215">When, on the contrary, public power is in the hands of the people, the sovereign power seeks everywhere for something better, because it has a sense of unease.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2216">The spirit of amelioration then extends to a thousand different objects; it gets down to infinite details and is applied, above all, to types of amelioration that cannot be achieved except by paying; for it is a matter of improving the condition of the poor who cannot help themselves.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2217">In addition there exists in democratic societies an agitation without a specific aim; a sort of permanent fever reigns there that turns toward all kinds of innovation, and innovations are nearly always costly.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>339<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2218">In monarchies and in aristocracies, the ambitious flatter the natural taste that carries the sovereign power toward fame and power, and they often push it therefore toward great expenditures.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2219">In democracies, where the sovereign power is needy, you can hardly gain its good will except by increasing its well-being; that can hardly ever be done except with money.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt931" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt931_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2220">Moreover, when the people themselves begin to reflect on their position, a host of needs arises that they had not felt at first and that can only be satisfied by turning to the resources of the State. As a result, public expenses seem generally to increase with civilization, and you see taxes rise as enlightenment spreads.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt932" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt932_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2221">Finally, a last cause often makes democratic government more expensive than another. Sometimes the democracy wants to economize on its expenditures, but it cannot succeed in doing so, because it does not have the art of being economical.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2222">As the democracy frequently changes views and, still more frequently, changes agents, it happens that enterprises are poorly conducted or remain incomplete.

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2224">One great reason leads democracies, in general, to economize on the salaries of public officials.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2225">In democracies, since those who institute the salaries are very numerous, they have very little chance ever to get them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2226">In aristocracies, on the contrary, those who institute large salaries almost always have a vague hope to profit from them. These salaries are capital that they create for themselves, or at the very least resources that they prepare for their children.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2227">It must be admitted, however, that democracy appears to be very parsimonious only toward its principal agents.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2228">In America, officials of secondary rank are paid more than elsewhere, but high officials are paid much less. [{There are states in which the Governor receives less money as a salary than one of our sub-prefects.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2229">These opposite effects are produced by the same cause; the people, in both cases, set the salaries of public officials. They think about their own needs, and this comparison guides them. Since they themselves live in great comfort, it seems natural to them that those who are serving them share it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt933" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt933_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a> But when it is time to set the lot of the great officers of the State, this rule escapes them, and they proceed only haphazardly.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>341<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2230">The poor man does not have a clear idea of the needs that the superior classes of society may feel. What would appear to be a modest sum to a rich man, appears to be a prodigious sum to the poor man who contents himself with what’s necessary; and he considers that the Governor of the state, provided with his two thousand <span class="ital">écus,</span> should still be happy and excite envy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt934" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt934_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2231">If you try to make him understand that the representative of a great nation must appear with a certain splendor in the eyes of foreigners, he will understand you at first. But when, thinking about his simple dwelling and about the modest fruits of his hard labor, he thinks about all that he could do with this very salary that you judge insufficient, he will find himself surprised and almost frightened by the sight of such riches.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2232">Add that the secondary official is nearly at the level of the people, while the other towers above them. So the first can still excite their interest, but the other begins to arouse their envy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2233">This is seen very clearly in the United States, where salaries seem in a way to decrease as the power of the officials grows greater.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt935" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt935_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">9</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>342<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2234">Under the dominion of aristocracy, on the contrary, high officials receive very large emoluments, while lower level ones often have hardly enough on which to live. It is easy to find the reason for this fact in causes analogous to those that we have indicated above.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt938" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt938_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2235">If the democracy does not imagine the pleasures of the rich man or envies them, the aristocracy from its perspective does not understand the miseries of the poor man; or rather it is unaware of them. The poor man is not, strictly speaking, similar to the rich man; he is a being of another species. So the aristocracy worries very little about the fate of its lower level agents. It raises their salaries only when they refuse to serve for too small a price.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2236">The parsimonious tendency of democracy toward principal officials has caused great economical propensities to be attributed to democracy that it does not have.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2237">It is true that democracy gives scarcely what is needed to live honestly to those who govern it, but it spends enormous sums to relieve the needs <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>343<span class="bracket">]</span></span> or to facilitate the pleasures of the people.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt939" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt939_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">10</a> That is a better use of the tax revenue, not an economy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2238">In general, democracy gives little to those who govern and a great deal to the governed. The opposite is seen in aristocracies where the money of the State profits above all the class that leads public affairs.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2256">Some have been much occupied recently with comparing the public expenditures of the United States with ours. All of these efforts have been without result, and a few words will suffice, I believe, to prove that it must be so.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>350<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2257">In order to be able to appreciate the extent of public expenses among a people, two operations are necessary: first, you must learn the wealth of this people, and then what portion of this wealth they devote to State expenditures. The person who researches the total amount of taxes without showing the extent of the resources that must provide them, would be pursuing unproductive work; for it is interesting to know not the expenditure, but the relation of the expenditure to the revenue.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2258">The same tax that a wealthy taxpayer easily bears will succeed in reducing a poor man to poverty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2259">The wealth of peoples is made up of several elements: real estate holdings form the first, personal property constitutes the second.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt953" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt953_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2260">It is difficult to know the extent of land suitable for cultivation that a nation possesses and its natural or acquired value. It is still more difficult to estimate all of the personal property that a people has at its disposal. Personal property, because of its diversity and amount, eludes almost all efforts of analysis.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2261">Consequently we see that the oldest civilized nations of Europe, even those in which the administration is centralized, have not yet established the state of their wealth in any precise way.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2262">In America, no one has even conceived the idea of trying. And how could you think to succeed in this new country where society has not yet peacefully and finally settled down, where the national government does not find at its disposal, as ours does, a multitude of agents whose efforts can be simultaneously commanded and directed; where, finally, statistics are not studied, because no one is found who has the power to gather the documents or the time to look through them?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2263">So the constituent elements of our calculations cannot be obtained. We do not know the comparative wealth of France and of the Union. The wealth of the one is not yet known, and the means to establish that of the other do not exist.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2264">But, for a moment, I agree to put aside this necessary term of comparison; I give up knowing the relationship of tax to revenue, and I limit myself to wanting to establish what the taxes are.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2265">The reader is going to recognize that by narrowing the circle of my research, I have not made my task easier.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2266">I do not doubt that the central administration of France, aided by all the officials at its disposal, might succeed in discovering exactly the total amount of direct or indirect taxes that weigh upon the citizens. But this <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>352<span class="bracket">]</span></span> work, which an individual cannot undertake, the French government itself has not yet finished, or at least it has not made the results known. We know what the State expenses are; the total of the departmental expenses is known; we do not know what happens in the French towns. So no one can say, as of now, what amount public expenditures in France total.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2267">If I now return to America, I notice difficulties that become more numerous and more insurmountable. The Union makes public the exact amount of its expenses; I can obtain for myself the individual budgets of the twenty-four states that constitute the Union; but who will teach me what the citizens spend for the administration of the county and of the town?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt954" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt954_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">11</a></p>

I add that it would even be dangerous to attempt it. When statistics are not based on rigorously true calculations, they mislead rather than guide. The mind is easily led astray by the false air of exactitude that statistics conserve even in their discrepancies, and it rests untroubled in the errors that it thinks are cloaked in the mathematical forms of truth.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2272">So let us abandon numbers and try to find our proof elsewhere.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2273">Does a country present an aspect of material prosperity; after paying the State, does the poor man still have resources and the rich man superfluity; do both appear satisfied with their lot, and do they still seek to improve it each day, so that industry never lacks capital and capital in turn does not lack industry? Lacking positive documents, it is possible to resort to such indicators to know if the public expenses that burden a people are proportionate to its wealth.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2274">The observer who kept to this evidence would undoubtedly judge that the American of the United States gives to the State a less significant portion of his income than the Frenchman.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2275">But how could you imagine that it would be otherwise?</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>355<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2276">One part of the French debt is the result of two invasions; the Union has nothing to fear about that. Our position obliges us as a rule to keep a numerous army under arms; the isolation of the Union allows it to have only 6,000 soldiers. We maintain nearly 300 ships; the Americans have only 52<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt958" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt958_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">14</a> of them. How could the inhabitant of the Union pay to the State as much as the inhabitant of France?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2277">So there is no parallel to establish between the finances of countries so differently placed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2278">It is by examining what happens in the Union, and not by comparing the Union with France, that we can judge if American democracy is truly economical.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2279">I cast my eyes on each of the various republics that form the confederation, and I discover that their government often lacks perseverance in its designs, and that it does not exercise continuous surveillance over the men it employs. From this I naturally draw the conclusion that it must often spend the money of the taxpayers uselessly, or devote more of their money than necessary to its undertakings.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2280">I see that, faithful to its popular origin, it makes prodigious efforts to satisfy the needs of the lower classes of society, to open the paths to power to them, and to spread well-being and enlightenment among them. It supports the poor, distributes millions each year to the schools, pays for all services, and generously recompenses its least important agents. If such a means of governing seems useful and reasonable to me, I am forced to recognize that it is expensive.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2281">I see the poor man who leads public affairs and has national resources at his disposal; and I cannot believe that, profiting from State expenditures, he does not often drag the State into new expenditures.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2282">So I conclude, without resorting to incomplete figures and without wanting to establish risky comparisons, that the democratic government of the Americans is not, as is sometimes claimed, an inexpensive government; <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>356<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and I am not afraid to predict that, if great difficulties came one day to assail the peoples of the United States, you would see taxes among them rise as high as in most of the aristocracies or monarchies of Europe.</p>

<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_103">Of the Corruption and Vices of Those Who Govern in Democracy; Of the Effects on Public Morality That Result from That Corruption and Those Vices</h2>
<div class="opener">
<div id="lf1593-01_argument_054" class="argument">
<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2283"><span class="ital">In aristocracies, those who govern sometimes seek to corrupt.— Often, in democracies, they prove to be corrupt themselves.—In the first, vices directly attack the morality of the people.—In the second, vices exercise an indirect influence on the morality of the people that is still more to be feared.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2284">Aristocracy and democracy mutually reproach each other with facilitating corruption; it is necessary to distinguish.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2285">In aristocratic governments, the men who come to public affairs are rich men who only want power. In democracies, the statesmen are poor and have their fortune to make.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2286">It follows that, in aristocratic States, those who govern are not very open to corruption and have only a very moderate taste for money, while the opposite happens among democratic peoples.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2287">But, in aristocracies, since those who want to arrive at the head of public affairs have great riches at their disposal, and since the number of those who can make them succeed is often circumscribed within certain limits, the government finds itself, in a way, up for sale.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt960" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt960_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a> In democracies, on the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>357<span class="bracket">]</span></span> contrary, those who aspire to power are hardly ever rich, and the number of those who contribute to gaining power is very great. Perhaps, in democracies, men are for sale no less, but there are hardly any buyers, and, besides, too many people would have to be bought at once to achieve the end. [≠As a result of this difference, in democracies corruption acts upon those who govern and in aristocracies upon the governed. In the one, public officials are corrupted; in the other, the people themselves.≠</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2288">Thus, corruption finds some way to be exercised in the two governments: its object alone varies.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2289">Among the men<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt961" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt961_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a> who have occupied power in France during the past forty years, several have been accused of having made a fortune at the expense of the State and its allies; a reproach that was rarely made to the public men of the old monarchy. But, in France, there is almost no example of someone buying the vote of an elector for money,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt962" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt962_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a> while this is notoriously and publicly done in England.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2290">[In aristocracies corruption is generally exercised in order to gain power. In democracies it is linked to those who have gained power. So in democratic <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>358<span class="bracket">]</span></span> States corruption harms the public treasury more than the morality of the people. It is the opposite in aristocracies.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2291">I have never heard it said that in the United States someone used his riches to win over the governed; but I have often seen the integrity of public officials called into question. Still more often I have heard their success attributed to low intrigues or to guilty maneuvers.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2292">[It must be said, moreover, that the result is not as fearsome in America as it would be in Europe.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2293">Great robberies can only be practiced among powerful democratic nations in which the government is concentrated in few hands and in which the State is charged with executing immense enterprises.]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt963" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt963_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2294">So if the men who lead aristocracies sometimes seek to corrupt, the heads of democracies are corrupted themselves. In the one, the morality of the people is directly attacked; in the other, an indirect action is exerted on the public conscience that must be feared even more.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2295">Among democratic peoples, those who head the State are almost always exposed to deplorable suspicions; so they give the support of the government, in a way, to the crimes of which they are accused. Thus they present dangerous examples to still struggling virtue, and provide glorious comparisons to hidden vice.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2296">You would say in vain that dishonest passions are met at all levels; that they often accede to the throne by the right of birth; that deeply despicable men can thus be found at the head of aristocratic nations as well as within democracies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2297">This response does not satisfy me. In the corruption of those who gain power by chance, something crude and vulgar is disclosed that makes it contagious to the crowd; on the contrary, there reigns, even in the depravities <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>359<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of great lords, a certain aristocratic refinement, an air of grandeur that often prevents its spread.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt964" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt964_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2298">The people will never penetrate the dark labyrinth of court spirit; it will always be difficult for them to discover the baseness hidden beneath the elegance of manners, the pursuit of taste, and the grace of language. But to rob the public treasury or to sell State favors for money, that the first wretch understands and can claim to be able to do in turn.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2299">What is to be feared, moreover, is not so much the sight of the immorality of the great as that of immorality leading to greatness. In democracy, simple citizens see a man who emerges from their ranks and who in a few years achieves wealth and power; this spectacle excites their surprise and envy; they try to find out how the one who was their equal yesterday is today vested with the right to lead them. To attribute his elevation to his talents or his virtues is uncomfortable, for it means admitting that they themselves are less virtuous and less skillful than he. So they place the principal cause in some of his vices, and often they are right to do so. In this way, I do not know what odious mixture of the ideas of baseness and power, of unworthiness and success, of utility and dishonor comes about.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2301">I forewarn the reader that here I am speaking about a government that follows the real will of the people, and not about a government that restricts itself only to commanding in the name of the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2302">There is nothing so irresistible as a tyrannical power that commands in the name of the people, because, while vested with the moral power that belongs to the will of the greatest number, it acts at the same time with the decisiveness, promptitude and tenacity that a single man would have.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2303">It is quite difficult to say what degree of effort a democratic government is capable of in time of national crisis.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2304">A great democratic republic has never been seen until now.

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2305">Now, since the Union was formed a half-century ago, its existence has been put in question only once, at the time of the War of Independence. At the beginning of this long war, there were extraordinary acts of enthusiasm for serving the country.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt966" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt966_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">15</a> But as the struggle continued, you saw individual egoism reappear.

<div class="cit">
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2306">the public expectation has been uniformly disappointed, and the treasuries of the States have remained empty. The popular system of administration, inherent in the nature of popular government, coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated state of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive collections, and has at length taught the different legislatures the folly of attempting them.</p>
</div>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2307">Since this period, the United States has not had to sustain a single serious war.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2308">To judge what sacrifices democracies know how to impose on themselves, we must therefore await the time when the American nation will be forced to put into the hands of its government half of the revenue of its property, like England, or must throw one twentieth of its population all at once onto the field of battle, as France did.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2309">In America, conscription is unknown; men are enrolled there for money. Forced recruitment is so contrary to the ideas and so foreign to the habits of the people of the United States that I doubt that anyone would ever dare to introduce it in the laws. What is called conscription in France assuredly is the heaviest of our taxes; but, without conscription, how would we be able to sustain a great continental war?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2310">The Americans have not adopted English impressment. They have nothing that resembles our registration of sailors. The navy, like the merchant marine, recruits by voluntary enlistments.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2311">Now, it is not easy to conceive that a people could sustain a great maritime war without resorting to one of the two means indicated above. Consequently, the Union, which has already fought with glory at sea, has never <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>362<span class="bracket">]</span></span> had large fleets, and the cost of manning the small number of its ships has always been very expensive.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2312">I have heard American statesmen admit that the Union will have difficulty maintaining its rank on the seas, if it does not resort to impressment or to registration of sailors; but the difficulty is to force the people, who govern, to bear impressment or registration of sailors.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt968" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt968_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2313">Incontestably, free peoples, when in danger, generally display an infinitely greater energy than those who are not free, but I am led to believe that this is true, above all, for free peoples among whom the aristocratic element predominates.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt969" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt969_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2314">Democracy seems to me much more appropriate for leading a peaceful society, or for making a sudden and vigorous effort as needed, than for braving for a long time the great storms in the political lives of peoples. The reason for it is simple. Men expose themselves to dangers and privations out of enthusiasm, but they remain exposed for a long time only from reflection. In what is called instinctive courage itself, there is more calculation than we think; and although, in general, passions alone bring about the first efforts, efforts continue with the result in mind. You risk a portion of what is dear in order to save the rest.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt970" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt970_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2315">Now, this clear perception of the future, based on learning and experience, must often be missing in democracy. The people feel much more than they reason; and if the present difficulties are great, the fear is that they will forget the greater difficulties that perhaps await them in case of defeat.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2316">Still another cause must make the efforts of a democratic government less long-lasting than the efforts of an aristocracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2317">The people not only see less clearly than the upper classes what can be hoped or feared in the future, but the people also suffer the troubles of the present quite differently from the upper classes. The nobleman, by exposing his person, runs as many chances for glory as perils. By giving the State the greater part of his income, he temporarily deprives himself of some of the pleasures of his wealth. But, for the poor man, death has no prestige, and the tax that bothers the rich man often attacks the poor man’s sources of life.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2318">This relative weakness of democratic republics in time of crisis is perhaps the greatest obstacle opposing the establishment of such a republic in Europe. For the democratic republic to survive without difficulty among a European people, it would have to be established at the same time among all the other European peoples.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2319">I believe that the government of democracy must, in the long run, increase the real forces of society; but it cannot assemble all at once, at one place, and at a given moment, as many forces as an aristocratic government or an absolute monarchy. If a democratic country remained under republican government for a century, you can believe that at the end of the century it would be richer, more populated and more prosperous than neighboring despotic States; but during this century, it would have run the risk several times of being conquered by them.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2321">This difficulty that democracy has in vanquishing passions and silencing the needs of the moment with the future in mind is noticeable in the United States in the smallest things.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2322">The people, surrounded by flatterers [and sycophants], succeed with difficulty in triumphing over themselves. Every time you want them to impose a privation or discomfort on themselves, even for an end their reason approves, they almost always begin by refusing. The obedience that Americans give to laws is rightly praised. It must be added that in America legislation is made by the people and for the people. So in the United States, the laws appear favorable to those who, everywhere else, have the greatest interest in violating it. Thus, it may be believed that a bothersome law, which the majority felt had no present utility, would not be put into effect or would not be obeyed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2323">In the United States, no legislation exists relating to fraudulent bankruptcies. Would it be because there are no bankruptcies? No, on the contrary, it is because there are many of them. The fear of being prosecuted as a bankrupt surpasses, in the mind of the majority, the fear of being ruined by bankruptcies; and in the public conscience there is a sort of culpable tolerance for the crime that each person condemns individually.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2324">In the new states of the Southwest, the citizens almost always take justice into their own hands, and murders<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt971" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt971_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a> happen constantly. That stems from the habits of the people being too rough and enlightenment being spread <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>365<span class="bracket">]</span></span> too little in these wilderness areas for anyone to feel the utility of giving the law some force. There they still prefer duels<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt972" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt972_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y.</a> to trials.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2325">Someone<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt973" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt973_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a> said to me one day, in Philadelphia, that nearly all crimes in America were caused by the abuse of strong liquors that the lower classes could use at will, because it was sold to them at a very low price. “Why,” I asked, “don’t you put a duty on brandy?” “Our legislators have often considered it,” he replied, “but it is a difficult undertaking. They fear a revolt; and besides, the members who voted for such a law would very surely not be reelected.” “So,” I responded, “among you, drinkers are the majority, and temperance is unpopular.”</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2326">When you point out these things to statesmen, they simply respond: Let time pass; feeling the evil will enlighten the people and will show them what they need. This is often true. If democracy has more chances to make a mistake than a king or a body of nobles, it also has more chances to return to the truth, once enlightenment comes; within a democracy there are generally no interests that are contrary to the interest of the greatest number and that fight reason. But democracy can only gain the truth by experience, and many peoples cannot wait for the results of their errors without perishing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2327">So the great privilege of the Americans is not only to be more enlightened than others, but also to have the ability to make mistakes that can be corrected.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2328">Add that, in order to profit easily from the experience of the past, democracy must already have reached a certain degree of civilization and enlightenment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2329">We see some peoples whose first education has been so perverted, and whose character presents such a strange mixture of passions, of ignorance and erroneous notions about everything, that they cannot by themselves discern the cause of their miseries; they succumb to evils that they do not know.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2330">I have traveled across vast countries formerly inhabited by powerful Indian nations that today no longer exist; I have lived among already mutilated tribes that, everyday, see their number decline and the splendor of their savage glory disappear; I have heard these Indians themselves foretell the final destiny reserved to their race. There is no European, however, who does not see what would have to be done to preserve these unfortunate peoples from inevitable destruction. But they do not see it; they feel the misfortunes that, each year, accumulate on their heads, and they will perish to the last man while rejecting the remedy. Force would have to be used to compel them to live.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2331">We are astonished to see the new nations of South America stir, for a quarter century, amid constantly recurring revolutions; and each day we expect to see them recover what is called their <span class="ital">natural state.</span> But who can assert that today revolutions are not the most natural state of the Spanish of South America? In this country, society struggles at the bottom of an abyss from which it cannot escape by its own efforts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2332">The people who inhabit this beautiful half of a hemisphere seem obstinately bound to eviscerate themselves; nothing can divert them. Exhaustion makes them come to rest for an instant, and rest soon brings them back to new furies. When I consider them in this alternating state of miseries and crimes, I am tempted to believe that for them despotism would be a benefit.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2339">Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships, or enmities.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2340">Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one People, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by justice shall Counsel.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2341">Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>368<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European Ambition, Rivalship, Interest, Humour or Caprice?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2342">’Tis our true policy to steer clear of permanent Alliances with any portion of the foreign world. So far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements (I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy). I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them. Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on a respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2343">Previously Washington had expressed this excellent and sound idea: “The Nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection.”</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2344">The political action of Washington always aimed to follow his maxims. He succeeded in keeping his country at peace, when all the rest of the universe was at war, and he established as a point of doctrine that the well understood interest of Americans was never to take part in the internal quarrels of Europe.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2345">Jefferson went still farther, and he introduced to the policy of the Union this other maxim: “That the Americans should never ask for privileges from foreign nations, so that they are never obligated themselves to grant such privileges.”<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt975" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt975_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2346">These two principles, which due to their obvious soundness were easily grasped by the crowd, have extremely simplified the foreign policy of the United States.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2347">Not mixing into Europe’s affairs, the Union has, so to speak, no foreign interests to discuss, for it does not yet have powerful neighbors in America [{it had to be grossly and groundlessly provoked in 1812 for it to consider taking up arms}]. Placed by its situation as much as by its will outside the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>369<span class="bracket">]</span></span> passions of the Old World, the Union does not have to protect itself from them anymore than to espouse them. As for the passions of the New World, they are still hidden in the future.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2348">[The Union grows constantly larger; it appears different each year, for its prosperity has something revolutionary about it. So the clear interest of the Union, which changes daily, is not to create lasting ties. Ties useful today could soon hamper its course and compromise its future.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2349">The Union is free from previous commitments; so it profits from the experience of the old peoples of Europe, without being obliged, like them, to make use of the past and to adapt the past to the present;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt976" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt976_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a> it is not forced, as they are, to accept an immense heritage handed down by its fathers, a mixture of glory and misery, of national friendships and hatreds. The foreign policy of the United States is eminently one of wait-and-see; it consists much more of refraining from action than of doing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2350">So it is very difficult to know, for now, what skill American democracy will develop in the conduct of the foreign affairs of the State.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt977" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt977_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> On this point, its adversaries as well as it friends must suspend their judgment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2351">As for me, I will have no difficulty in saying: it is in the leadership of the foreign interests of society that democratic governments seem to me decidedly inferior to others.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt978" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt978_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> In democracy, experience, mores, and education <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>370<span class="bracket">]</span></span> almost always end by creating the sort of everyday practical wisdom and the skill in the small events of life that is called good sense. Good sense suffices for the ordinary routine of society; and among a people whose education is already accomplished, democratic liberty applied to the internal affairs of the State produces greater good than the evil that can be caused by the errors of democratic government. But it is not always so in the relations of one people with another.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2352">Foreign policy requires the use of almost none of the qualities that belong to democracy and, on the contrary, demands the development of nearly all those qualities that it lacks. Democracy favors the growth of the internal resources of the State; it spreads comfort, develops public spirit; strengthens respect for law in the different classes of society; all things that have only an indirect influence on the position of a people vis-à-visanother. But only with difficulty can democracy coordinate the details of a great undertaking, settle on one plan and then follow it stubbornly across all obstacles. It is little capable of devising measures in secret and patiently awaiting their result. These are the qualities that belong most particularly to a man or to an aristocracy. Now, in the long run it is precisely these qualities that make a people, like an individual, predominate in the end.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2353">If, on the contrary, you pay attention to the natural defects of aristocracy,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt979" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt979_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> you will find that the effect that these defects can produce can be felt hardly at all in the leadership of the foreign affairs of the State. The capital vice for which the aristocracy is reproached is to work only for itself alone <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>371<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and not for the mass. In foreign policy, it is very rare for the aristocracy to have an interest distinct from that of the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2354">The inclination that leads democracy in policy matters to obey sentiments rather than reasoning, and to abandon a long developed plan for the satisfaction of a momentary passion, clearly revealed itself in America when the French Revolution broke out. The simplest insights of reason would suffice then, as today, to make the Americans understand that it was not in their interest to get engaged in the struggle that was going to cover Europe in blood, and from which the United States could suffer no harm.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2355">The sympathies of the people in favor of France came out with such violence, however, that nothing less was required to prevent a declaration of war against England than the unyielding character of Washington and the immense popularity that he enjoyed.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt980" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt980_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> And yet, the efforts made by the austere reason of this great man to combat the generous but unthinking passions of his fellow citizens very nearly deprived him of the only recompense that he had ever expected, the love of his country. The majority pronounced against his policy; now, the whole people approve it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt981" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt981_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">17</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2356">If the Constitution and public favor had not given Washington the leadership of the foreign affairs of the State, the nation would certainly have done then precisely what it condemns today.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt982" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt982_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>372<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2357">Nearly all the peoples who have acted strongly on the world, those who have conceived, followed and executed great designs, from the Romans to the English, were led by an aristocracy; and how can you be surprised [≠when you see the part that must be attributed to the continuous effect of the same will in human events≠]?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2358">In this world, what is most steady in its views is an aristocracy. The mass of people can be seduced by its ignorance or its passions. You can catch the mind of a king unawares and make him vacillate in his plans; and, besides, a king is not immortal. But an aristocratic body is too numerous to be won over, too few in number to yield easily to the intoxication of unthinking passions. An aristocratic body is a firm and enlightened man who does not die.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt983" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt983_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2359">[Before beginning this chapter I feel the need to explain myself. I do not want my thought enclosed within limits that I have not set.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2360">When I speak generally about the advantages of {that a country can gain from} the government of democracy, I am not talking only about the government that democracy has provided for itself in America, but about all types of government that emanate from democracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2361">Every time that the government of a people is the sincere and permanent <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>376<span class="bracket">]</span></span> expression of the will of the greatest number, that government, whatever the forms, is democratic.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt987" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt987_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2362">So democracy can rule over a unified nation as over a confederation, in a monarchy as in a republic.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2363">I admit that of all governments the one that seems to me most natural to democracy is republican government. When the social state of a people turns toward democracy, the republic becomes for them a probable consequence of this social state; but I do not believe that it is a necessary consequence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2364">If the majority of all the citizens do violence to the instincts of equality that are natural to them and, favoring order and governmental stability, consent to vest the attributes of executive power in a family or a man who, while still leading, depends on them, there is nothing in that that shocks reason. So the rule of all and the government [v: the administration] of one man can be seen at the same time. I confess that this much reduces royal majesty, but the time is coming when, if kings do not want to take the places left [v: still offered] to them, they will no longer find any to take.]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt988" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt988_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2365">Before beginning the present chapter, I feel the need to remind the reader of what I have already pointed out several times in the course of this book.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2366">The political constitution of the United States seems to me one of the forms that democracy can give to its government; but I do not consider American institutions as either the only or the best that a democratic people should adopt.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2367">So by making known what good things the Americans gain from the government of democracy, I am far from claiming or thinking that such advantages can only be obtained with the help of the same laws.</p>

<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_108">Of the General Tendency of Laws under the Dominion of American Democracy, and Of the Instinct of Those Who Apply Them</h2>
<div class="opener">
<div id="lf1593-01_argument_058" class="argument">
<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2368"><span class="ital">The vices of democracy are immediately apparent.—Its advantages are seen only in the long run.—American democracy is often clumsy, but the general tendency of its laws is beneficial.—Public officials, under American democracy, have no permanent interests that differ from those of the greatest number.—What results from that.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2369">The vices and weaknesses of the government of democracy are easily seen; they are demonstrated by obvious facts, while its salutary influence is exerted in an imperceptible and, so to speak, hidden way. Its drawbacks are striking at first sight, but its qualities are revealed only in the long run.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2370">The laws of American democracy are often defective or incomplete; it happens that they violate vested rights or sanction dangerous ones. Were they good, their frequency would still be a great evil. All of this is seen at first glance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2371">So why do the American republics live on and prosper?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2372">In laws, the end that they seek must be carefully distinguished from the way in which they move toward that end; their absolute goodness, from goodness that is only relative.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt989" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt989_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>378<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2373">I suppose that the purpose of the legislator is to favor the interests of the few at the expense of those of the many; his measures are devised in a way to obtain the result that he wants in the least time and with the least possible effort. The law will be well made; its aim, bad. It will be dangerous in proportion to its very effectiveness.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2374">The laws of democracy tend, in general, toward the good of the greatest number, for they emanate from the majority of all citizens; the majority can be mistaken, but cannot have an interest against itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2375">Those of aristocracy tend, on the contrary, to monopolize wealth and power in the hands of the few, because the aristocracy by its nature always forms a minority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2376">So we can say, in a general way, that the purpose of democracy, in its legislation, is more useful to humanity than the purpose of aristocracy in its legislation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2377">But its advantages end there.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2378">Aristocracy is infinitely more skillful in the science of lawmaking than democracy can be. Having self-control, aristocracy is not subject to passing impulses; it has long-term plans that it knows how to develop until the favorable opportunity presents itself. Aristocracy proceeds skillfully; it knows the art of bringing together at the same time, toward the same point, the collective force of all its laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2379">Not so with democracy; its laws are nearly always defective or ill-timed. [In the eyes of the world, laws badly made or made at the wrong time discredit the legislative spirit of democracy.]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt990" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt990_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>379<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2380">So the means of democracy are more imperfect than those of aristocracy. Democracy, without wanting to, often works against itself; but its end is more useful.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2381">Imagine a society that nature, or its constitution, had organized in a way to bear the transient effect of bad laws, a society that, without perishing, can await the result of the <span class="ital">general tendency of the laws;</span><a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt991" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt991_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> and you will understand that, of all governments, the government of democracy, despite its flaws, is still the most appropriate to make this society prosper.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2382">This is precisely what happens in the United States; here I repeat what I have already expressed elsewhere: the great privilege of the Americans is to be able to make mistakes that can be corrected.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2383">I will say something analogous about public officials.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2384">It is easy to see that American democracy is often wrong in its choice of the men to whom it confides power; but it is not as easy to say why the State prospers in their hands.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2385">Note first that, in a democratic State, if those who govern are less honest or less capable, the governed are more enlightened and more attentive.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2386">In democracies, the people, constantly occupied as they are with their affairs and jealous of their rights, prevent their representatives from departing from a certain general line drawn by the interest of the people.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>380<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2387">Note too that if the democratic magistrate exercises power worse than another, he generally holds it for less time.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt992" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt992_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2388">But there is a more general and more satisfying reason than the latter.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2389">It is undoubtedly important for the good of nations that those who govern have virtues and talents; but perhaps it is even more important to them that those who govern have no interests contrary to the mass of the governed; for, in this case, virtues could become nearly useless, and talents, destructive.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2390">I said it was important that those who govern have no interests contrary to or different from the mass of the governed; I did not say it was important that they had interests similar to those of <span class="ital">all</span> the governed, for I am not aware that such a thing has yet been seen.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2391">The political form has not yet been found that equally favors the development and the prosperity of all the classes that make up society. These classes have continued to form like so many distinct nations in the same nation, and experience has proved that it was nearly as dangerous to put the fate of the others completely in the hands of any one of them as to make one people the arbiter of the destiny of another people. When the rich alone govern, the interest of the poor is always in danger; and when the poor make the laws, the interest of the rich runs great risks. So what is the advantage of democracy? The real advantage of democracy is not, as some have said, to favor the prosperity of all, but only to serve the well-being of the greatest number.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2392">Those charged, in the United States, with leading public affairs are often <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>381<span class="bracket">]</span></span> inferior in capacity and morality to the men whom aristocracy would bring to power; but their interest merges and is identified with that of the majority<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt993" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt993_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a> of their fellow citizens. So they can commit frequent infidelities and serious errors, but they will never systematically follow a tendency hostile to this majority; and they can never impart an exclusive and dangerous direction to the government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2393">The bad administration of a magistrate, under democracy, is moreover an isolated fact that has influence only during the short term of the administration. Corruption and incompetence are not common interests that can bind men together in a permanent way.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2394">A corrupt or incompetent magistrate will not combine his efforts with another magistrate for the sole reason that the latter is, like him, incompetent and corrupt; and these two men will never work in unison to make corruption and incompetency flower among their descendants. On the contrary, the ambition and the maneuvering of the one will serve to unmask the other. In democracies, the vices of the magistrate are, in general, entirely personal.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2395">But public men, under the government of aristocracy, have a class interest that, if it sometimes merges with the interest of the majority, often remains distinct from it. This interest forms a common and lasting bond among these public men; it invites them to unite and to combine their efforts toward an end that is not always the happiness of the greatest number. It not only links those who govern with each other; it also links them with a considerable portion of the governed, for many citizens, without holding any office, are part of the aristocracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2396">So the aristocratic magistrate finds a constant support in society, at the same time that he finds one in government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2397">This common objective that, in aristocracies, unites magistrates with the interest of a part of their contemporaries, also identifies them with and, so to speak, subjects them to future races. They work for the future as well as for the present. So the aristocratic magistrate is pushed simultaneously toward the same point, by the passions of the governed, by his own, and I could almost say by the passions of his posterity.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>382<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2398">How can we be surprised if he doesn’t resist? Consequently, in aristocracies we often see even those not corrupted by class spirit dragged along by it and unknowingly made to adapt society little by little to their own use and to prepare it for their descendants.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2399">I do not know if an aristocracy has ever existed as liberal as that of England, and that has, without interruption, provided the government of the country with men as worthy and as enlightened.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2400">It is easy to recognize, however, that in English legislation the good of the poor has often ended by being sacrificed to that of the rich,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt994" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt994_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a> and the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>383<span class="bracket">]</span></span> rights of the greatest number to the privileges of a few. Therefore, within England today all the greatest extremes of fortune are present together, and miseries are found there that nearly equal its power and glory.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt995" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt995_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2401">In the United States, where public officials have no class interest to insist upon, the general and continuous course of government is beneficial, even though those who govern are often lacking in skill and sometimes contemptible.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2402">So there is, at the heart of democratic institutions, a hidden tendency that often makes men work toward the general prosperity, despite their vices or errors, while in aristocratic institutions a secret inclination is sometimes uncovered that, despite talents and virtues, carries them toward contributing to the miseries of their fellows. In this way, in aristocratic governments, public men can do evil without wanting to do so, and in democracies, they can produce good without thinking to do so.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt996" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt996_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2404">We would see some peoples enjoy a greater mass of well-being and prosperity than other peoples and, when we came to examine the detail of their government, we would find something to correct in each of its actions.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2405">Other peoples would have something more than the usual state of human miseries as their share, and their public affairs would seem wisely conducted.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2410">There exists a love of country that has its source principally in the unthinking, disinterested and indefinable sentiment that binds the heart of the man to the places where the man was born. This instinctive love is mingled with <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>385<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the taste for ancient customs, with respect for ancestors, and the memory of the past; those who experience it cherish their country as one loves the paternal home. They love the tranquillity that they enjoy there; they are fond of the peaceful habits that they contracted there; they are attached to the memories that it offers, and even find some sweet pleasure in living there in obedience. Often this love of country is intensified even more by religious zeal, and then you see it accomplish miracles. It is itself a kind of religion; it does not reason, it believes; it feels; it acts. Some peoples have been found who have, in some way, personified the country and have caught sight of it in the prince. So they have transferred to him a part of the sentiments that compose patriotism; they have boasted about his triumphs and have been proud of his power. There was a time, under the old monarchy, when the French felt a sort of joy in feeling themselves given, without recourse, to the arbitrariness of the monarch, and said with pride: “We live under the most powerful king in the world.”<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt999" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt999_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2411">Like all unthinking passions, this love of country encourages great episodic efforts rather than continuity of efforts. After saving the State in time of crisis, it often leaves it to decline amid peace. [≠This love of country is found in the cradle of societies; it presides during the early ages of peoples.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2412">When peoples are still simple in their mores and firm in their beliefs; when society rests gently upon an old order of things, whose legitimacy is uncontested, you see this instinctive love of country reign.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1000" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1000_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2413">There is another love of country more rational than that one; less generous, less ardent perhaps, but more fruitful and more durable; this one arises from enlightenment; it develops with the help of laws; it grows with the exercise of rights; and it ends up merging, in a way, with personal interest. A man understands the influence that the well-being of the country has on his own; he knows that the law allows him to contribute to bringing <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>386<span class="bracket">]</span></span> this well-being into being, and he interests himself in the prosperity of his country, first as something useful to him and then as his work.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2414">But sometimes, in the life of peoples, a moment occurs when ancient customs are changed, mores destroyed, beliefs shaken, the prestige of memories has vanished, yet when enlightenment has remained incomplete and political rights poorly guaranteed or limited. Then men no longer see the country except in a weak and doubtful light; they no longer locate it either in the soil, which in their eyes has become an inanimate land, or in the customs of their ancestors, which they have been taught to regard as a burden; or in religion, which they doubt; or in the laws, which they do not make, or in the legislator, whom they fear and scorn. So they see it nowhere, not under its own features any more than under any other, and they withdraw into a narrow and unenlightened egoism. These men escape prejudices without recognizing the empire of reason; they have neither the instinctive patriotism of monarchy, nor the thoughtful patriotism of the republic; but they have stopped between the two, in the middle of confusion and misery.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2415">What is to be done in such a state? Go back. But peoples do not return to the sentiments of their youth any more than men to the innocent tastes of early years; they can regret them, but not make them come again. So it is necessary to move ahead and hasten to unite, in the eyes of the people, individual interest and the interest of the country, for disinterested love of country flies away never to return.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1001" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1001_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2416">I am surely far from claiming that to reach this result we must suddenly grant the exercise of political rights to all men; but I say that the most powerful means, and perhaps the only one remaining to us, to interest men in the fate of their country, is to make them participate in its government. Today, civic spirit seems to me inseparable from the exercise of political rights; and I think that from now on, we will see the number of citizens in Europe increase or decrease in proportion to the extension of these rights.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2417">How is it that in the United States, where the inhabitants arrived yesterday on the soil that they occupy, where they brought neither customs, nor memories; where they meet for the first time without knowing each other; where, to put it in a word, the instinct for native land can hardly exist; how is it that each person is involved in the affairs of his town, of his district, and of the entire State as his very own? Because each person, in his sphere, takes an active part in the government of society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2418">The common man in the United States has understood the influence that general prosperity exercises over his own happiness, an idea so simple and yet so little known by the people. He has, moreover, become accustomed to regarding this prosperity as his work. So, in public fortune, he sees his own, and he works for the good of the State, not only by duty or by pride, but I would almost dare to say by cupidity.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>388<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2419">[He values his rights as a citizen as his rights as a proprietor, and he takes an interest in the State as in his cottage or in the field that his labors have made fruitful.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2420">It is not necessary to study the institutions and the history of the Americans to know the truth of the preceding; the mores alert you to it well enough. The American, taking part in all that is happening in this country, believes it is in his interest to defend all that you criticize there; for it is not only his country that you then attack, it is himself. Consequently, you see his national pride resort to all the artifices and descend to all the puerilities of individual vanity.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2421">[An American in his country resembles a lover of gardens on his grounds. Don’t you admire this rock? Is there anything more graceful than the contour of this stream? Aren’t these trees planted well and to good effect? Whatever you say, do not hope to satisfy him. The reason is simple. You admire what is good, and he admires his work.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2422">There is nothing more annoying in the experience of life than this irritable patriotism of the Americans. The foreigner would gladly agree to praise a great deal in their country; but he would want them to allow him to find fault with something, and that is what they absolutely refuse.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2423">So America is a country of liberty, where, to hurt no one, the foreigner must not speak freely about individuals, nor the State, nor the governed, nor those who govern, nor public enterprises, nor private enterprises, about nothing in fact that you find there, except perhaps for climate and soil; even then you find some Americans ready to defend the one and the other as if they had taken part in their formation.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1002" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1002_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2424">Today it is necessary to know how to make up your mind and dare to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>389<span class="bracket">]</span></span> choose between the patriotism of all and the government of a few, for you cannot at the same time combine the social strength and activity given by the first with the guarantees of tranquillity sometimes provided by the second.</p>

<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_110">Of the Idea of Rights in the United States</h2>
<div class="opener">
<div id="lf1593-01_argument_060" class="argument">
<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2425"><span class="ital">There are no great peoples without the idea of rights.—What is the way to give the people the idea of rights.—Respect for rights in the United States.—What gives rise to it.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2426">After the general idea of virtue, I do not know any more beautiful than that of rights, or rather, these two ideas merge. The idea of rights is nothing more than the idea of virtue introduced into the political world.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2427">With the idea of rights, men have defined what license and tyranny were. Enlightened by it, each person has been able to show himself independent without arrogance and submissive without servility. The man who obeys violence yields and abases himself; but when he submits to the right of command that he acknowledges in his fellow, he rises, in a way, above even the one commanding him. There are no great men without virtue; without respect for rights, there is no great people. You can almost say that there is no society; for what is a gathering of rational and intelligent beings bound together only by force?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1003" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1003_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>390<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2428">I wonder what way there is today to inculcate men with the idea of rights and to make it apparent to their senses, so to speak; and I only see a single one; it is to give all of them the peaceful exercise of certain rights. You see that clearly with children, who are men, except for strength and experience. When a child begins to move among external objects, instinct leads him to put everything that comes within reach to his own use; he has no idea of the property of others, not even that of existence; but as he is informed about the cost of things and as he discovers that things can, in turn, be taken from him, he becomes more circumspect and ends by respecting in his fellows what he wants them to respect in him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2429">What happens to the child concerning toys, happens later to the man concerning all the objects belonging to him. Why in America, country of democracy par excellence, does no one raise against property in general the complaints that often resound in Europe? Is it necessary to say? In America there are no proletarians. Each person, having an individual possession to defend, recognizes in principle the right of property.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2430">In the political world, it is the same. In America the common man has conceived a high idea of political rights, because he has political rights; he does not attack the rights of others, so that no one violates his. And while in Europe this same man has no regard even for the sovereign authority, the American submits without murmuring to the power of the least of his magistrates.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2431">This truth appears even in the smallest details of the existence of peoples. In France, there are few pleasures exclusively reserved for the upper classes of society; the poor man is admitted almost everywhere the rich man is able <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>391<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to enter. Consequently you see him conduct himself with decency and respect all that is useful for the enjoyments that he shares. In England, where wealth has the privilege of pleasure, like the monopoly of power, the complaint is that when the poor man succeeds in getting furtively into the place destined for the pleasures of the rich man, he loves to cause pointless damage. Why be astonished by this? Care has been taken so that he has nothing to lose.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2432">The government of democracy makes the idea of political rights descend to the least of citizens, as the division of property puts the idea of the right of property in general within reach of all men. That is one of its greatest merits in my view.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2433">I am not saying that it is an easy thing to teach all men to use political rights; I am only saying that, when it is possible, the effects that result are great.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2434">And I add that if there is a century when such an enterprise must be attempted, that century is our own.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2435">Don’t you see that religions are growing weaker and that the divine notion of rights is disappearing? Don’t you find that mores are becoming corrupted and that, with them, the moral notion of rights is fading away?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2436">Don’t you see, on all sides, beliefs giving way to reasoning, and sentiments, to calculation? If, in the midst of this universal disturbance, you do not succeed in linking the idea of rights to personal interest, which offers itself as the only fixed point in the human heart, what will you have left for governing the world, if not fear?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1004" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1004_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>392<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2437">So when you say to me that laws are weak, and the governed, turbulent; that passions are intense, and virtue, powerless, and that in this situation you must not think about increasing the rights of democracy, I answer that, because of these very things, I believe you must think about it; and in truth, I think that governments have still more interest in it than society does, for governments perish, and society cannot die.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1005" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1005_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a> However, I do not want to abuse the example of America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2438">In America, the people were vested with political rights in a period when it was difficult for them to make poor use of those rights, because the citizens were few and had simple mores. While growing, the Americans have not increased the powers of democracy; rather they have extended its sphere. [That is an invaluable advantage.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2439">It cannot be doubted that the moment when political rights are granted to a people who have, until then, been deprived of them is a moment of crisis, a crisis often necessary, but always dangerous.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2440">The child inflicts death when he is unaware of the value of life; he takes property from others before knowing that someone can rob him of his. The common man, at the moment when he is granted political rights, finds himself, in relation to his rights, in the same position as the child vis-à-vis all of nature. In this case the celebrated phrase [of Hobbes] applies to him: <span class="ital">Homo puer robustus.</span><a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1006" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1006_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>393<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2441">This truth is even revealed in America. The states in which citizens have enjoyed their rights for the longest time are those in which the citizens know best how to make use of their rights.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2442">It cannot be said too much. There is nothing more fruitful in wonders than the art of being free; but there is nothing harder than apprenticeship in liberty. It is not the same with despotism. Despotism often presents itself as the repairer of all the misfortunes suffered; it is the support of legitimate rights, the upholder of the oppressed, and the founder of order. Peoples fall asleep amid the temporary prosperity that it brings forth; and when they awaken, they are miserable. Liberty, in contrast, is usually born amid storms; it is established painfully in the midst of civil discord, and only when it is already old can its benefits be known.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2444">It is not always possible to call the whole people, either directly or indirectly, to the making of the law; but it cannot be denied that, when it is practicable, the law thereby acquires a great authority. This popular origin, which often harms the goodness and wisdom of the legislation, contributes singularly to its power.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1008" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1008_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2445">In the expression of the will of an entire people, there is a prodigious strength. When it comes clearly to light, even the imagination of those who would like to fight against it is as though overwhelmed.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>394<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2446">The truth of this is well known by parties.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2447">Consequently, you see them contest the majority wherever they can. When they lack the majority of those who voted, they place it among those who have abstained from voting; and when, even there, the majority escapes them, they find it among those who do not have the right to vote.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2448">In the United States, except for slaves, servants, and the poor provided for by the towns, there is no one who is not a voter and who, as such, does not indirectly contribute to the law. So those who want to attack the laws are reduced to doing conspicuously one of two things; they must either change the opinion of the nation, or trample its will underfoot.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2449">Add to this first reason another more direct and more powerful, that in the United States each person finds a kind of personal interest in having everyone obey the laws; for the one who is not part of the majority today will perhaps be among its ranks tomorrow; and this respect that he now professes for the will of the legislator, he will soon have the occasion to demand for his own will. So, however annoying the law, the inhabitant of the United States submits without trouble, not only as a work of the greatest number, but also as his own; he considers it from the point of view of a contract to which he would have been a party.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2450">So in the United States, you do not see a numerous and always turbulent crowd who, seeing the law as a natural enemy, only looks upon it with fear and suspicion. On the contrary, it is impossible not to see that all classes show a great confidence in the legislation that governs the country and feel a kind of paternal love for it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2451">I am wrong in saying all classes. In America, since the European scale of powers is reversed, the rich find themselves in a position analogous to that of the poor in Europe; they are the ones who often distrust the law. I have said it elsewhere: the real advantage of democratic government is not to guarantee the interests of all, as has sometimes been claimed, but only to protect those of the greatest number. In the United States, where the poor man governs, the rich have always to fear that he will abuse his power against them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2452">This disposition of the mind of the rich can produce a muted discontent; but society is not violently troubled by it; for the same reason that <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>395<span class="bracket">]</span></span> prevents the rich man from giving his confidence to the legislator prevents him from defying his commands. He does not make the law, because he is rich; and he does not dare to violate it, because of his wealth. In general, among civilized nations, only those who have nothing to lose revolt. Therefore, if the laws of democracy are not always respectable, they are nearly always respected; for those who generally violate the laws cannot fail to obey the laws that they have made and from which they profit, and the citizens who could have an interest in breaking them are led by character and by position to submit to whatever the will of the legislator is. Moreover, the people, in America, not only obey the law because it is their work, but also because they can change it when by chance it injures them; they submit to it first as an evil that they imposed on themselves, and then as a temporary evil.</p>

In the one, the only question is improvement and progress; you would say that society, in the other, having gained all good things, aspires only to rest in order to enjoy them. The country that gets so worked up to be happy is, however, generally richer <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>396<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and more prosperous than the one that seems so satisfied with its lot. And in considering the one and the other, you have difficulty imagining how so many new needs make themselves felt each day in the first, while so few seem to be experienced in the second.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1009" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1009_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2455">If this remark is applicable to free countries that have retained monarchical form and to those in which aristocracy dominates, it is very much more applicable to democratic republics. There, it is no longer a portion of the people that sets out to improve the state of society; the whole people take charge of this concern. It is a matter of providing for the needs and conveniences not only of a class, but of all classes at the same time.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1010" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1010_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2456">It is not impossible to imagine the immense liberty that the Americans enjoy. You can also have an idea of their extreme equality, but what you cannot understand, without having already witnessed it, is the political activity that reigns in the United States.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2457">Scarcely have you landed on American soil than you find yourself in the middle of a sort of tumult; a confused clamor arises on all sides; a thousand voices reach your ear at the same time; each one expresses various social needs. Around you, everything stirs: here, the people of a neighborhood have gathered to know if a church should be built; there, some are working on choosing a representative; farther along, the deputies of a district go as fast as they can to the city, in order to see to certain local improvements; in another place, it is the farmers of the village who abandon their fields to go to discuss the plan of a road or of a school. Some citizens assemble for the sole purpose of declaring that [{freemasonry menaces the security of the State}] they disapprove of the government’s course; while others gather <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>397<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to proclaim that the men in office are the fathers of the country. Here are still others who, seeing drunkenness as the principal source of the evils of the State, come to pledge solemnly to give an example of temperance.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1011" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1011_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2458">The great political movement that constantly agitates American legislatures, the only one that is noticed outside, is only an episode and a sort of prolongation of the universal movement that begins in the lowest ranks of the people and then reaches, one by one, all classes of citizens. You cannot work harder to be happy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2459">It is difficult to say what place political concerns occupy in the life of a man in the United States. To get involved in the government of society and to talk about it, that is the greatest business and, so to speak, the only pleasure that an American knows. This is seen even in the smallest habits of his life; women themselves often go to public assemblies and, by listening to political speeches, relax from household cares. For them, clubs replace theatrical entertainments to a certain point. An American does not know how to converse, but he discusses; he does not discourse, but he holds forth. He always speaks to you as to an assembly; and if he happens by chance to get excited, he will say: Gentlemen, while addressing his interlocutor.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2460">In certain countries, the inhabitant accepts only with a kind of repugnance the political rights that the law grants him; dealing with common interests seems to rob him of his time, and he loves to enclose himself within a narrow egoism exactly limited by four ditches topped by hedges.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2461">In contrast, from the moment when the American would be reduced to attending only to his own affairs, half of his existence would be taken away <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>398<span class="bracket">]</span></span> from him; he would feel an immense emptiness in his days, and he would become unbelievably unhappy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1013" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1013_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2462">I am persuaded that if despotism ever succeeds in becoming established in America, it will have even more difficulties overcoming the habits that liberty has engendered than surmounting the love of liberty itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2463">This constantly recurring agitation that the government of democracy has introduced into the political world passes afterward into civil society. Everything considered, I do not know if that is not the greatest advantage of democratic government, and I praise it much more for what it causes to be done than for what it does.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2464">Incontestably the people often direct public affairs very badly; but the people cannot get involved in public affairs without having the circle of their ideas expand, and without seeing their minds emerge from their ordinary routine. The common man who is called to the government of society conceives a certain esteem for himself. Since he is then a power, very enlightened minds put themselves in the service of his. People speak to him constantly in order to gain his support, and by seeking to deceive him in a thousand different ways, they enlighten him. In politics, he takes part in enterprises that he did not conceive, but that give him a general taste for enterprises. Every day new improvements to make to common property are pointed out to him, and he feels the desire to improve his personal property arise. Perhaps he is neither more virtuous nor more happy, but he is more enlightened and more active than his predecessors. I do not doubt that democratic institutions, joined with the physical nature of the country, are the cause, not direct, as so many people say, but indirect of the prodigious movement of industry that is noticed in the United States. It is not the laws that give birth to it, but the people learn to produce it by making the law.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1015" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1015_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2465">When the enemies of democracy claim that one man does what he undertakes better than the government of all, it seems to me that they are right. The government of one man, supposing equality of enlightenment on both sides, brings more consistency to its enterprises than that of the multitude; it shows more perseverance, more of an idea of the whole, more perfection in details, a more correct discernment in the choice of men. [{So a republic is not administered as well as a monarchy, supposing equality of enlightenment on both sides.}] Those who deny these things have never seen a democratic republic, or have judged only on a small number of examples. Democracy, even when local circumstances and the dispositions of the people allow it to persist, does not offer the sight of administrative regularity and methodical order in government; that is true. Democratic liberty does not execute each of its enterprises with the same perfection as intelligent despotism; often it abandons them before gaining the fruit, or chances dangerous ones; but in the long run it produces more than despotism; it does not do each thing as well, but it does more things. Under its dominion, it is, above all, not what the public administration executes that is great, but what is executed without it and outside of it. Democracy does not give the people the most skillful government, but it does what the most skillful government is often impotent to create; it spreads<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1016" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1016_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> throughout the social body a restless activity, a superabundant force, an energy that never exists without it and that, if only circumstances are favorable, can bring forth wonders. Those are its true advantages.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2466">In this century, when the destinies of the Christian world appear to be in suspense, some hasten to attack democracy like a powerful enemy, while it is still growing; others already adore it as a new god coming out of nothingness; but both know only imperfectly the object of their hate or their desire; they fight in the shadows and strike only at random.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2467">What do you ask of society and its government? We must understand one another.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2468">Do you want to give the human spirit a certain nobility, a generous fashion of envisioning the things of this world? Do you want to inspire in men a sort of contempt for material goods? Do you desire to bring about or to maintain profound convictions and prepare great devotions?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2469">Is it a matter for you of polishing mores, of elevating manners, of making the arts shine? Do you want poetry, fame, and glory?</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2471">If such, in your view, is the principal object that men must propose for themselves in society, do not opt for the government of democracy; it would not lead you surely to the goal.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2472">But if it seems useful to you to divert the intellectual and moral activity of man toward the necessities of material life, and to use it to produce well-being; if reason appears to you more profitable to men than genius; if your object is not to create heroic virtues, but peaceful habits; if you like to see vices more than crimes, and prefer to find fewer great actions, on the condition of encountering fewer cases of heinous crimes; if, instead of acting within the bosom of a brilliant society, it is enough for you to live in the midst of a prosperous society; if, finally, in your view, the principal object of a government is not to give the entire body of the nation the most strength or the most glory possible, but to provide for each of the individuals that make up the society the most well-being and to avoid the most misery; then equalize conditions and constitute the government of democracy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1017" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1017_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>

</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2475">The very essence of democratic governments is that the dominion of the majority be absolute; for, in democracies, nothing outside of the majority can offer resistance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2476">Most of the American constitutions have also sought to augment this natural strength of the majority artificially.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1020" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1020_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2477">Of all political powers, the legislature is the one that most willingly obeys the majority. The Americans have wanted the members of the legislature to be named <span class="ital">directly</span> by the people, and for a <span class="ital">very short</span> term, in order to force them to submit not only to the general views, but also to the daily passions of their constituents.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2478">They have taken the members of the two houses from the same classes and named them in the same way; in this way, the movements of the legislative body are almost as rapid and no less irresistible than those of a single assembly.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1022" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1022_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>404<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2479">Within the legislature thus constituted, the Americans gathered together nearly the entire government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2480">At the same time that the law increased the strength of powers that were naturally strong, it weakened more and more those that were naturally weak. It gave to the representatives of the executive power neither stability nor independence; and, by subjecting them completely to the caprices of the legislature, it took from them the little influence that the nature of democratic government would have allowed them to exercise.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1023" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1023_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2481">In several states, the law delivered the judicial power to election by the majority; and in all, it made the existence of the judicial power dependent, in a way, on the legislative power, by leaving to the representatives the right to fix the salaries of judges annually.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1024" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1024_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2482">Customs have gone still further than the laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2483">In the United States, a custom is spreading more and more that will end by making the guarantees of representative government empty; it happens very frequently that the voters, while naming a deputy, trace a plan of conduct for him and impose on him a certain number of definite obligations from which he cannot deviate in any way. Except for the tumult, it is as if the majority itself deliberated in the public square.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2484">Several particular circumstances in America also tend to make the power of the majority not only predominant, but irresistible.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2485">The moral dominion of the majority is based in part on the idea that there is more enlightenment and wisdom in many men combined than in one man alone, more in the number than in the choice of legislators. It is the theory of equality applied to minds. This doctrine attacks the pride of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>405<span class="bracket">]</span></span> man in its last refuge. Consequently the minority admits it with difficulty and gets used to it only with time. Like all powers, and perhaps more than any other, the power of the majority thus needs to last in order to seem legitimate. When it is beginning to be established, it makes itself obeyed by force; only after living under its laws for a long time do you begin to respect it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2486">The idea that the right to govern society belongs to the majority because of its enlightenment was carried to the soil of the United States by the first inhabitants. This idea, which alone would be enough to create a free people, has today passed into the mores, and you find it in the least habits of life.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2487">The French, under the old monarchy, held as a given that the king could do no wrong;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1025" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1025_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> and when he happened to do something wrong, they thought that the fault was with his advisors. This facilitated obedience marvelously. You could murmur against the law, without ceasing to love and respect the law-maker. Americans have the same opinion about the majority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2488">The moral dominion of the majority is based as well on the principle that the interests of the greatest number must be preferred to those of the few. Now, it is easily understood that the respect professed for this right of the greatest number naturally increases or decreases depending on the state of the parties. When a nation is divided among several great irreconcilable interests, the privilege of the majority is often unrecognized, because it becomes too painful to submit to it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2489">If a class of citizens existed in America that the legislator worked to strip of certain exclusive advantages, held for centuries, and that he wanted to bring down from an elevated position and restore to the ranks of the multitude, it is probable that the minority would not easily submit to his laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2490">But since the United States was populated by men equal to each other, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>406<span class="bracket">]</span></span> no natural and permanent dissidence is yet found among the interests of the various inhabitants.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1026" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1026_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2491">There is such a social state in which the members of the minority cannot hope to attract the majority because to do so it would be necessary to abandon the very object of the struggle that the minority wages against the majority. An aristocracy, for example, cannot become a majority while preserving its exclusive privileges, and it cannot allow its privileges to slip away without ceasing to be an aristocracy. [In these countries, it is almost impossible for the moral power of the majority ever to succeed in being recognized by all.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2492">In the United States, political questions cannot be posed in as general and absolute a way, and all parties are ready to recognize the rights of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>407<span class="bracket">]</span></span> majority, because all hope one day to be able to exercise those rights to their profit.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2493">So in the United States the majority has an immense power in fact and a power of opinion almost as great; and once the majority has formed on a question, there is, so to speak, no obstacle that can, I will not say stop, but even slow its course and leave time for the majority to hear the cries of those whom it crushes as it goes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2494">The consequences of this state of affairs are harmful and dangerous<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1027" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1027_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a> for the future.</p>

<div class="opener">
<div id="lf1593-01_argument_064" class="argument">
<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2495"><span class="ital">How the Americans increase legislative instability, which is natural to democracy, by changing the legislator annually and by arming him with an almost limitless power.— The same effect produced in the administration.—In America a force infinitely greater, but less sustained than in Europe is brought to social improvements.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2496">I spoke previously of the vices that are natural to the government of democracy; there is not one of them that does not grow at the same time as the power of the majority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2497">And, to begin with the most obvious of all.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2498">Administrative instability is an evil inherent in democratic government, because it is in the nature of democracies to bring new men to power. But this evil is greater or lesser depending on the power and the means of action granted to the legislator.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2499">In America sovereign power is handed over to the authority that makes the laws. That authority can rapidly and irresistibly abandon itself to each of its desires, and every year it is given other representatives. That is to say, what has been adopted is precisely the combination that most favors democratic <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>408<span class="bracket">]</span></span> instability and that allows democracy to apply its changeable will to the most important objects. [≠We have seen under the National Assembly and the Convention how, by granting omnipotence to the legislative body, the natural instability of law in republics increased more. These extreme consequences of a bad principle cannot recur in the same way in America because American society is not in revolution as French society then was and because there has been a long apprenticeship in liberty in America.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2500">America today is, therefore, the country in the world where laws have the shortest duration. Nearly all the American constitutions have been amended during the last thirty years. So, during this period, there is no American state that has not modified the principle of its laws.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1028" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1028_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2501">As for the laws themselves, it is sufficient to glance at the archives of the different states of the Union to be persuaded that in America the activity of the legislator never flags.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1029" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1029_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> Not that the American democracy is by nature more unstable than another, but in the formation of the laws, it has been given the means to follow the natural instability of its inclinations.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1030" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1030_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2502">The omnipotence of the majority and the rapid and absolute manner in which its will is executed in the United States not only make the law unstable, but also exercise the same influence on the execution of the law and on the action of public administration.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2503">Since the majority is the only power important to please, the works that it undertakes are ardently supported; but from the moment when its attention <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>409<span class="bracket">]</span></span> goes elsewhere, all efforts cease; whereas in the free States of Europe, in which administrative power has an independent existence and an assured position, the will of the legislator continues to be executed, even when he is occupied by other objects.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2504">In America, much more zeal and activity is brought to certain improvements than is done elsewhere.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2505">In Europe, an infinitely smaller, but more sustained social force is applied to the same things.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2506">[I saw some striking examples of what I am advancing in a matter that I had particular occasion to examine in the United States.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2507">Several years ago some religious men undertook to improve the condition of prisons. The public was roused by their voice, and the regeneration of criminals became a popular undertaking.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2508">Then new prisons arose. For the first time, the idea of reforming the guilty penetrated the jail at the same time as the idea of punishing him. But the happy revolution that the public joined with so much fervor and that the simultaneous efforts of citizens made irresistible could not be accomplished in one moment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2509">Alongside some new penitentiaries, the development of which was hastened by the desire of the majority, the old prisons still existed and continued to house a great number of the guilty. The latter seemed to become more unhealthy and more corrupting as the new ones became more reforming and healthier. This double effect is easily understood: the majority, preoccupied by the idea of founding the new establishment, had forgotten the one that already existed. By each person averting his eyes from the object that no longer attracted the regard of the master, supervision had ceased. At first the salutary bonds of discipline were seen to relax and then, soon after, to break. And alongside the prison, lasting monument of the mildness and enlightenment of our time, was found a dungeon that recalled the barbarism of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2510">[In France, it would be very difficult to find prisons as good and as bad as in the United States.]</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2512">I regard as impious and detestable this maxim that in matters of government the majority of a people has the right to do anything, and yet I consider that the will of the majority is the origin of all powers. Do I contradict myself?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2513">A general law exists that has been made, or at least adopted, not only by the majority of such or such people, but by the majority of all men. This law is justice.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2514">So justice forms the limit of the right of each people [to command].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2515">A nation is like a jury charged with representing universal society and with applying justice, which is its law.

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2516">So when I refuse to obey an unjust law, I am not denying the right of the majority to command; I am only appealing from the sovereignty of the people to the sovereignty of the human race.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2517">There are men who are not afraid to say that, in objects that concern only itself, a people could not go entirely beyond the limits of justice and reason, and that we should not be afraid, therefore, to give all power to the majority that represents a people. But that is the language of a slave.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2518">So what is a majority taken as a whole, if not an individual who has opinions and, most often, interests contrary to another individual called the minority. Now, if you admit that an individual vested with omnipotence can abuse it against his adversaries, why would you not admit the same thing for the majority? Have men, by gathering together, changed character? By becoming stronger, have they become more patient in the face of obstacles?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1033" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1033_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> As for me, I cannot believe it; and the power to do everything that I refuse to any one of my fellows, I will never grant to several.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1034" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1034_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2519">Not that I believe that, to preserve liberty, several principles can be mixed together in the same government, in a way that truly opposes them to each other.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2520">The government called mixed has always seemed to me a chimera. Truly <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>412<span class="bracket">]</span></span> speaking, there is no mixed government (in the sense that is given to this term), because, in each society, you eventually discover a principle of action that dominates all the others.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2521">England of the last century, which was particularly cited as an example of this sort of government, was an essentially aristocratic State, although some large elements<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1035" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1035_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a> of democracy were found within it; for the laws and the mores there were established in such a way that eventually the aristocracy would always predominate and lead public affairs as it willed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2522">The error arose because, seeing the interests of the great constantly in conflict with those of the people, only the struggle was considered, instead of paying attention to the result of this struggle, which was the important point. When a society truly comes to have a mixed government, that is a government equally divided among contrary principles, it enters into revolution or dissolves.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1036" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1036_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2523">So I think that a social power superior to all others must always be placed somewhere, but I believe liberty is in danger when this power encounters no obstacle that can check its course<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1037" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1037_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a> and give it time to moderate itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2524">Omnipotence in itself seems to me something bad and dangerous.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1038" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1038_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a> Its <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>413<span class="bracket">]</span></span> exercise seems to me beyond the power of man, whoever he may be; and I see only God who can, without danger, be all powerful, because his wisdom and his justice are always equal to his power. So there is no authority on earth so respectable in itself, or vested with a right so sacred, that I would want to allow it to act without control or to dominate without obstacles. So when I see the right and the ability to do everything granted to whatever power, whether called people or king, democracy or aristocracy, whether exercised in a monarchy or a republic, I say: the seed of tyranny is there and I try to go and live under other laws.</p>

The police are nothing other than the majority under arms. To the jury? The jury is the majority vested with the right to deliver judgments. The judges themselves, in certain states, are elected by the majority.

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2527">Suppose, in contrast, a legislative body composed in such a way that it represents the majority, without necessarily being the slave of the majority’s passions; an executive power that has a strength of its own; and a judicial power independent of the two other powers; you will still have a democratic government, but there will no longer be hardly any chances for tyranny.</p>

Tyranny can be exercised by means of the law itself, and then it is not arbitrary; arbitrariness can be exercised in the interests of the governed, and then it is not tyrannical.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1044" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1044_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2533">In the United States, the omnipotence of the majority, at the same time that it favors the legal despotism of the legislator, also favors the arbitrariness of the magistrate. Because the majority has absolute control over making the law and supervising its execution, and has equal control over those governing and those governed, it regards public officials as its passive agents and willingly relies on them to take care of serving its designs. So the majority does not enter in advance into the details of the duties of public officials and scarcely takes the trouble to define their rights. It treats them as a master would treat his servants, if, having their behavior always in view, he could direct or correct their conduct at every moment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2534">In general, the law leaves American officials much more free than ours within the circle that is drawn around them. Sometimes the majority even allows them to go outside of this circle. Guaranteed by the opinion of the greatest number and strong because of their support, they then dare things that a European, accustomed to the spectacle of arbitrariness, still finds astonishing.

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2536">When you come to examine how thought is exercised in the United States, you notice very clearly to what extent the power of the majority surpasses all the powers that we know in Europe.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>417<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2537">Thought is an invisible and almost imperceptible power that scoffs at all tyrannies [that scoffs amid chains and executioners. {You could say of it what Malherbe said of death: it does not stop at the gates of the Louvre any more than at the door of the poor man}].<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1045" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1045_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a> Today, the most absolute sovereigns of Europe cannot prevent certain ideas hostile to their authority from circulating silently within their States and even within their courts. It is not the same in America; as long as the majority is uncertain, people speak; but as soon as the majority has irrevocably decided, everyone is silent, and friends as well as enemies then seem to climb on board together. The reason for this is simple. There is no monarch so absolute that he can gather in his hands all of society’s forces and vanquish opposition in the way that a majority vested with the right to make and execute laws can [at will, vested with the right and the force].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2538">A king, moreover, has only a physical power that acts on deeds and cannot reach wills; but the majority is vested with a strength simultaneously physical and moral, which acts on the will as well as on actions and which at the same time prevents the deed and the desire to do it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2539">I know of no country where, in general, there reigns less independence of mind and true freedom of discussion than in America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2540">There is no religious or political theory that may not be freely preached in the constitutional States of Europe and that does not penetrate into the others [{and I do not know of} ≠a European people so powerful and so strong that it is not forced from time to time to hear hard truths. It is not this way in America.≠]; for there is no country in Europe so subject to a single power that someone who wants to speak the truth does not find some support capable of insuring him against the results of his independence. If he has the misfortune to live under an absolute government, he often has the people for him; if he lives in a free country, he can find shelter, as needed, behind royal authority. The aristocratic part of society sustains him in democratic countries, and democracy in the others. But within a democracy organized as that of the United States, only a single power <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>418<span class="bracket">]</span></span> is found, a single element of strength and success, and nothing outside of it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1046" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1046_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2541">In America, the majority draws a formidable circle around thought. Within these limits, the writer is free; but woe to him if he dares to go beyond them. It isn’t that he has to fear an auto-da-fé, but he is exposed to all types of distasteful things and to everyday persecutions. A political career is closed to him; he has offended the only power that has the ability to open it to him. Everything is denied him, even glory. Before publishing his opinions, he believed he had some partisans; it seems to him that he has them no longer, now that he has revealed himself to all; for those who censure him speak openly, and those who think as he does, without having his courage, keep quiet and distance themselves. He gives in; finally, under the daily effort, he yields and returns to silence, as though he felt remorse for having told the truth.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2542">Chains and executioners, those are the crude instruments formerly used by tyranny; but today civilization has perfected even despotism itself, which seemed however to have nothing more to learn.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2543">Princes had, so to speak, materialized violence; the democratic republics of today have made violence as entirely intellectual as the human will that it wants to constrain. Under the absolute government of one man, despotism, to reach the soul, crudely struck the body; and the soul, escaping from these blows, rose gloriously above it; but in democratic republics, tyranny does not proceed in this way; it leaves the body alone and goes right to the soul. The master no longer says: You will think like me or die; he says: You are free not to think as I do; your life, your goods, everything remains with you; but from this day on you are a stranger among us. You will keep your privileges as a citizen, but they will become useless to you. If you aspire to be the choice of your fellow citizens, they will not choose you, and if you ask only for their esteem, they will still pretend to refuse it to you. You will remain among men, but you will lose your rights to humanity. When you approach your fellows, they will flee from you like an impure being. And those who believe in your innocence, even they will <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>419<span class="bracket">]</span></span> abandon you, for people would flee from them in turn. Go in peace; I spare your life, but I leave you a life worse than death.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2544">Absolute monarchies had dishonored despotism. Let us be careful that democratic republics do not rehabilitate it, and that, while making despotism heavier for some, they do not, in the eyes of the greatest number, remove its odious aspect and its degrading character.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2545">Among the proudest nations of the Old World, books have been published that intended faithfully to portray the vices and absurdities of their contemporaries. La Bruyère lived at the palace of Louis XIV when he composed his chapter on the great, and Molière criticized the court in the plays that he had performed before the courtiers. But the dominating power in the United States does not understand being played in this way. The slightest reproach wounds it; the smallest biting truth shocks it, and everything from the forms of its language to its most solid virtues must be praised. No writer, no matter how famous, can escape this obligation to heap praise upon his fellow citizens. So the majority lives in perpetual self-adoration; only foreigners or experience can bring certain truths to the ears of Americans.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2546">If America has not yet had great writers, we do not have to look elsewhere for the reasons: literary genius does not exist without freedom of the mind, and there is no freedom of the mind in America.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1047" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1047_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2547">The Inquisition was never able to prevent the circulation in Spain of books opposed to the religion of the greatest number. The dominion of the majority does better in the United States: it has removed even the thought of publishing such books. Unbelievers are found in America, but unbelief finds, so to speak, no organ there.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1048" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1048_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2548">You see governments that strive to protect morals by condemning the authors of licentious books. In the United States, no one is condemned for this kind of work; but no one is tempted to write them. It is not that all citizens have pure morals, but the majority is steady in its morals.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2549">Here, the use of power is undoubtedly good. I am, consequently, speaking only about the power itself. This irresistible power is an unremitting fact, and its good usage is only an accident. [Doesn’t the majority in Paris acquire a taste for the filth that sullies our theatres daily?]</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2551">The influence of what precedes is still felt only weakly in political society; but its harmful effects are already noticeable on the national character of the Americans. I think that the small number of outstanding men who appear today on the political stage must be attributed, above all, to the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>421<span class="bracket">]</span></span> always increasing action of the despotism of the majority in the United States.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2552">When the American Revolution broke out, outstanding men appeared in large number; then public opinion led and did not tyrannize over wills. The famous men of this period, freely joining the movement of minds, had a grandeur of their own; they shed their brilliance on the nation and did not derive it from the nation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2553">In absolute governments, the great who are near the throne flatter the passions of the master and willingly bow to his caprices. But the mass of the nation does not lend itself to servitude; it often submits out of weakness, habit or ignorance, sometimes out of love of royalty or the king. We have seen peoples take a type of pleasure or pride in sacrificing their will to that of the prince and, in this way, give a kind of independence of soul to the very act of obedience. Among these peoples much less degradation than misery is found. There is, moreover, a great difference between doing what you do not approve or pretending to approve what you do; the one is done by a weak man, but the other belongs only to the habits of a valet.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1049" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1049_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2554">In free countries, in which each person is more or less called to give his opinion on matters of State; in democratic republics, in which public life is constantly mingled with private life, in which the sovereign is approachable from all sides, and in which it is only a matter of raising one’s voice to reach the sovereign’s ear, many more people are found who seek to bank on the sovereign’s weaknesses and to live at the expense of the sovereign’s passions, than in absolute monarchies. Not that men there are naturally worse than elsewhere, but temptation is stronger and is offered to more people at the same time. A much more general debasing of souls results.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2555">Democratic republics put the courtier spirit within reach of the greatest number and make it penetrate into all classes at the same time. It is one of the principal reproaches that can be made against them.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>422<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2556">That is true, above all, in democratic states organized like the American republics, in which the majority possesses such absolute and irresistible dominion, that, in a way, you must renounce your rights as a citizen and, so to speak, your position as a man when you want to deviate from the road marked out by the majority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2557">Among the immense crowd, in the United States, that pushes into a political career, I saw very few men who showed this virile candor, this manly independence of thought, that often distinguished Americans in former times and that, wherever it is found, forms the salient feature of great characters. At first view, you would say that in America minds have all been formed on the same model because they so exactly follow the same paths. Sometimes, it is true, the foreigner will encounter some Americans who deviate from the rigor of the formulas; these Americans happen to deplore the vice of the laws, the variableness of democracy and its lack of enlightenment; often they even go so far as to notice the defects that are spoiling the national character, and they indicate the measures that could be taken to correct those defects. But no one, except you, is listening to them; and you, to whom they confide these secret thoughts, you are only a passing foreigner. They willingly give you truths that are useless to you, and, coming into the public square, they use another language.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2558">If these lines ever reach America, I am sure of two things: first, that readers will all raise their voices to condemn me; second, that many among them will absolve me deep down in their conscience.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1050" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1050_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2559">I have heard country spoken about in the United States.

This is easily understood <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>423<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by analogy: despotism depraves the one submitted to it much more than the one who imposes it. In absolute monarchies, the king often has great virtues; but the courtiers are always vile.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2560">[≠What I blame democratic republics for is putting the courtier spirit within reach of such a large number.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2561">It is true that courtiers, in America, do not say: Sire and Your Majesty, a grand and capital difference; but they talk constantly about the natural enlightenment of their master. They do not raise the question of knowing which one of the virtues of the prince most merits adoration; for they assert that he possesses all virtues, without having acquired them and, so to speak, without wanting to do so. They do not give him their wives and daughters so that he would deign to elevate them to the rank of his mistresses; but by sacrificing their opinions to him, they prostitute themselves.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2562">Moralists and philosophers in America are not forced to envelop their opinions in veils of allegory; but, before hazarding an annoying truth, they say: We know that we are speaking to a people too far above human weaknesses ever to lose control of itself. We would not use such language, if we did not address men whose virtues and enlightenment make them alone, among all others, worthy of remaining free.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2563">How could those who flattered Louis XIV do better?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2564">As for me, I believe that in all governments, whatever they are, baseness will attach itself to strength and flattery to power. And I know only one way to prevent men from degrading themselves: it is to grant to no one, with omnipotence, the sovereign power to debase them.</p>

The truth is that, once war has flared up there among the parties, government loses its effect on society. But I do not think that the nature of a democratic power is to lack strength and resources; I believe, on the contrary, that it is almost always the abuse of its forces and the bad use of its resources that make it perish.

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2573">In a society under the forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker individual is not secured against the violence of the stronger; and as, in the latter state, even the stronger individuals<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1055" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1055_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a> are prompted, by the uncertainty of their condition, to submit to a government which may protect the weak as well as themselves; so, in the former state, will the more powerful factions or parties be gradually induced, by a like motive, to wish for a government which will protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful.

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2578">Previously I distinguished two types of centralization; one, I called governmental, and the other administrative.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1059" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1059_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2579">Only the first exists in America; the second is almost unknown there.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2580">If the power that directs American societies found these two means of government at its disposal, and combined, with the right to command everything, the ability and the habit of carrying out everything by itself; if, after establishing the general principles of government, it entered into the details of application, and after regulating the great interests of the country, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>428<span class="bracket">]</span></span> it could reach as far as individual interests, liberty would soon be banished from the New World.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1060" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1060_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2581">But, in the United States, the majority, which often has the tastes and instincts of a despot, still lacks the most advanced instruments of tyranny.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2582">In none of the American republics has the central government ever taken charge of anything other than a small number of objects whose importance attracted its attention. It has never undertaken to regulate the secondary things of society. Nothing indicates that it has ever even conceived the desire to do so. The majority, while becoming more and more absolute, has not increased the attributions of the central power; it has only made it omnipotent in its sphere. Thus despotism can be very heavy at one point, but it cannot extend to all.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1061" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1061_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2583">Besides, however carried away the national majority may be by its passions; however ardent it is in its projects, it cannot in all places, in the same way, and in the same moment, make all citizens yield to its desires.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1062" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1062_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> When the central government that represents the national majority <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>429<span class="bracket">]</span></span> has given orders as a sovereign, it must rely, for the execution of its command, on agents who often do not depend on it and that it cannot direct at every moment. So the municipal bodies and county administrations form like so many hidden reefs that slow or divide the tide of popular will. Were the law oppressive, liberty would still find a refuge in the way in which the law would be executed; the majority cannot get into the details, and, if I dare say so, into the puerilities of administrative tyranny. The majority does not even imagine that it can do so, for it is not entirely aware of its power. It still knows only its natural strength and is unaware of how far art could extend its limits.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2584">This merits reflection.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1063" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1063_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> If a democratic republic like that of the United States ever came to be established in a country where the power of one man had already established administrative centralization and introduced it into habits, as well as into laws, I am not afraid to say that, in such a republic, despotism would become more intolerable than in any of the absolute monarchies of Europe. It would be necessary to look to Asia in order to find something comparable.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2586">[≠I said elsewhere that the American magistracy was vested with a great political power; it remains for me to see how it tends to exercise its power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2587">American judges are named by the executive power {or by the legislature}; they are hardly ever chosen by the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2588">But had you made judges chosen directly by the people, by making them irremovable, you would have given them instincts entirely different from those of the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2589">From the moment when a public official is vested with an office for life, he takes a personal interest in society remaining immobile. If he is not always the enemy of progress, he is definitely the enemy of revolutions, and if this official is a man of the law, he is naturally carried by education to prize stability and he becomes attached to stability by inclination.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2590">In fact, in what could be called the spirit of the jurist there is something singularly aristocratic.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2591">Whoever will not allow himself to be preoccupied by a fact but by the ensemble of facts, not by a particular period but by the succession of times, will easily discover this tendency in the spirit of the jurist.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2592">When you visit the Americans and study their laws, you see that the authority that they have given to jurists and the influence that the Americans have allowed them to take in government form today the most powerful barrier to the errors of democracy. To me this effect seems due to a general cause that it is useful to try to determine, because it can recur elsewhere.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2593">Jurists have been mixed up in all the movements of political society in Europe for five hundred years. Sometimes they have served as instruments of the political powers; sometimes they have used the political powers as instruments. In the Middle Ages, jurists cooperated wonderfully in extending the domination of kings; since then, they have worked powerfully <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>432<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to restrict this very power. In England, they were seen to unite intimately with the aristocracy; in France they revealed themselves as its most dangerous enemies. So do jurists yield only to sudden and momentary impulses, or, depending on circumstances, do they more or less obey instincts that are natural to them and that always recur? I would like to clarify this point; for jurists are perhaps called upon to play the first role in the political society trying to be born.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2594">Men who have made law their specialty have drawn from this work habits of order, a certain taste for forms, a sort of instinctive love for the regular succession of ideas, that make them naturally strongly opposed to the revolutionary spirit and to the unthinking passions of democracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2595">[{This effect is larger or smaller depending on how you study the law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2596">In countries like France, where all legislation is written [the jurist (ed.)] contracts the taste for what is regular and legal.}</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2597">≠Furthermore, in countries where the law of precedents rules, such as England and America, the taste and respect for what is old are almost always merged in the soul of the jurist with the love of what is legal.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2598">It is not the same in countries where, as in France, the whole legislation is found written in codes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2599">The English jurist tries to determine what has been done; the French jurist, what the intention was. The first wants≠ evidence; the second, arguments. The one wants decisions; the other wants reasons. [Cf. infra (ed.)]]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2600">The special knowledge that jurists acquire while studying the law assures them a separate rank in society. They form a sort of privileged class among intelligent people. Each day they rediscover the idea of this superiority in the exercise of their profession; they are masters of a necessary science, the knowledge of which is not widespread; they serve as arbiters among citizens, and the habit of leading the blind passions of the litigants toward the goal gives them a certain contempt for the judgment of the crowd. Add that they naturally form a <span class="ital">corps.</span> It isn’t that they agree among themselves and head in concert toward the same point; but the community of study and unity of methods link their minds, as interest could unite their wills.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>433<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2601">So you find hidden at the bottom of the soul of jurists a portion of the tastes and habits of the aristocracy. Like the aristocracy, they have an instinctive propensity for order, a natural love of forms; like the aristocracy, they conceive a great distaste for the actions of the multitude and secretly despise the government of the people.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1065" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1065_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2602">I do not want to say that these natural tendencies of jurists are strong enough to bind them in an irresistible way. What dominates jurists, as all men, is particular interest, and above all the interest of the moment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2603">There is a kind of society where men of the law cannot take a rank in the political world analogous to the one that they occupy in private life; you can be sure that, in a society organized in this way, the jurists [despite their natural tastes] will be very active agents of revolution. But then you must try to determine if the cause that leads them to destroy or to change arises among them from a permanent disposition or from an accident. It is true that jurists singularly contributed to overturning the French monarchy in 1789.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1066" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1066_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a> It remains to be known if they acted in this way because they had studied the laws, or because they could not contribute toward making them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1067" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1067_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>434<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2604">Five hundred years ago, the English aristocracy put itself at the head of the people and spoke in their name; today it upholds the throne and makes itself the champion of royal authority.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1068" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1068_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> The aristocracy, however, has instincts and tendencies that are its own.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2605">You must also guard against taking isolated members of the corps for the corps itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2606">In all free governments, of whatever form, you will find jurists among the first ranks of all parties. This same remark is also applicable to the aristocracy. Nearly all the democratic movements that have agitated the world have been led by nobles.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2607">An elite body can never be sufficient for all the ambitions that it contains; there are always more talents and passions than posts, and you do not fail to find a large number of men there who, not able to grow great quickly enough by using the privileges of the corps, seek to grow great by attacking its privileges.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2608">So I do not claim that a period will come when <span class="ital">all</span> jurists, or that in <span class="ital">all</span> times, most jurists must appear as friends of order and enemies of change.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2609">I am saying that in a society where jurists occupy without dispute the elevated position that belongs to them naturally, [and with all the more reason in the society where they occupy the first rank] their spirit will be eminently conservative and will show itself to be antidemocratic.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1069" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1069_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2610">When the aristocracy closes its ranks to jurists, it finds in them enemies <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>435<span class="bracket">]</span></span> all the more dangerous because, below the aristocracy in wealth and power, they are independent of the aristocracy by their work and feel themselves on its level by their enlightenment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2611">But every time the nobles have wanted to share some of their privileges with the jurists, these two classes have found it very easy to join together and have, so to speak, discovered themselves to be of the same family.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2612">I am equally led to believe that it will always be easy for a king to make jurists the most useful instruments of his power.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1070" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1070_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2613">There is infinitely more natural affinity between men of the law and the executive power than between them and the people, although jurists often have to overthrow the first; just as there is more natural affinity between the nobles and the king than between the nobles and the people, even though you have often seen the superior classes of society combine with the others to struggle against royal power. [Jurists often fear the king, but they always despise the people.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2614">What jurists love above all things is the sight of order, and the greatest guarantee of order is authority. It must not be forgotten, moreover, that if they prize liberty, they generally put legality much above it; they fear tyranny less than arbitrariness and, provided that the legislator himself sees to taking independence away from men, they are more or less content.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2615">So I think that the prince who, in the presence of an invasive democracy, would seek to break down the judicial power in his States and to diminish the political influence of jurists, would commit a great error. He would let go of the substance of authority in order to seize its shadow.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2616">I do not doubt that it would be more profitable for him to introduce jurists into the government. After entrusting despotism to them in the form <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>436<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of violence, perhaps he would rediscover it in their hands with the features of justice and the law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2617">[As for me, I would never advise any people to leave to the courts the care of guaranteeing its liberty. I would be afraid that the courts would sacrifice it to monarchs or to themselves. This care concerns great political assemblies.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2618">The government of democracy is favorable to the political power of jurists. When the rich man, the nobleman and the prince are excluded from government, the jurists arrive there by right, so to speak; for then they are the only enlightened and skillful men that the people can choose outside of themselves.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1071" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1071_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2619">If jurists are led naturally toward the aristocracy and the prince by their tastes, they are led naturally toward the people by their interest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2620">Thus, jurists love the government of democracy, without sharing its tendencies and without imitating its weaknesses, double cause to be powerful by democracy and over democracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2621">The people, in a democracy, do not distrust jurists, because they know that the interest of jurists is to serve their cause; they listen to them without anger, because they do not assume that jurists have an ulterior motive.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1072" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1072_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a> In fact, jurists do not want to overturn the government that democracy has established, but they strive constantly to lead it along a path that is not its own and by means that are foreign to it. The jurist belongs to the people by his interest and by his birth and to the aristocracy by his habits and his tastes; he is like the natural liaison between these two, like the link that unites them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2622">The body of jurists forms the only aristocratic element that can mingle with the natural elements of democracy without effort and combine with them in a happy and enduring way. I am not unaware of the faults inherent <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>437<span class="bracket">]</span></span> in the spirit of jurists; without this mixture of the spirit of jurists with the democratic spirit, I doubt, however, that democracy could govern society for long, and I cannot believe that today a republic could hope to maintain its existence, if the influence of jurists in public affairs did not increase in proportion to the power of the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2623">This aristocratic character that I see in the spirit of jurists is still more pronounced in the United States and in England than in any other country. This is due not only to the study of the law made by English and American jurists, but also to the very nature of legislation and to the position that these interpreters occupy among these two peoples.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2624">The English and the Americans have kept the law of precedents, that is, they continue to draw from the opinions and legal decisions of their fathers the opinions that they must have in matters of the law and the decisions they must render.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2625">So with an English or American jurist, the taste and respect for what is old is nearly always mingled with love of what is regular and legal.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2626">This has still another influence on the turn of mind of jurists and consequently on the course of society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2627">The English or American jurist seeks what has been done; the French jurist, what you must have wanted to do; [the first, evidence; the second, arguments] the one wants judgments, the other wants reasons.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2628">When you listen to an English or American jurist, you are surprised to see him so often cite the opinion of others, and to hear him speak so little about his own, while among us the contrary happens.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2629">No affair that the French lawyer agrees to handle is so small that he treats it without introducing a system of his own ideas; and he will examine even the constituent principles of the law so that the court be pleased in this regard to have the boundary marker of a disputed inheritance moved back about six feet.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2630">This sort of abnegation of his own sense made by the English and American jurist in order to rely on the sense of his fathers; this type of servitude, in which he is obliged to maintain his thought, must give the spirit of the jurist more timid habits and make him acquire more stationary tendencies in England and America than in France [for a fact is very much more immobile than an idea or an argument].</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>438<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2631">Our written laws are often difficult to understand, but everyone can read them; in contrast, there is nothing more obscure to the common people and less accessible to them than legislation founded on precedents. This need for the jurist in England and in the United States, this high idea of his knowledge, separate him more and more from the people, and end by putting him in a class apart. The French jurist is only a learned man, but the English or American man of the law in a way resembles the priests of Egypt; like them, he is the sole interpreter of an occult science.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2632">The position that the men of the law occupy in England and in America exercises an influence no less great on their habits and their opinions. The aristocracy of England, which has taken care to draw to its bosom everything that had some natural analogy to it, has given a very great portion of consideration and power to jurists. In English society jurists are not at the first rank, but they consider themselves content with the rank that they occupy. They form something like the junior branch of the English aristocracy, and they love and respect their seniors, without sharing all their privileges. So the English jurists combine with the aristocratic interests of their profession the aristocratic ideas and tastes of the society in which they live.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2633">Therefore in England, above all, you can see in relief the type of jurist that I am trying to paint: the English jurist esteems the laws, not so much because they are good as because they are old; and, if he sees himself reduced to modifying them on some point in order to adapt to the changes that societies are subjected to by time, he resorts to the most incredible subtleties in order to persuade himself that, by adding something to the work of his fathers, he is only developing their thought and completing their efforts. Do not hope to make him recognize that he is an innovator; he will consent to go to absurd lengths before admitting himself guilty of such a great crime. In England was born this legal spirit that seems indifferent to the heart of things in order to pay attention only to the letter, and that would rather go beyond reason and humanity than go beyond the law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2634">English legislation is like an ancient tree on which jurists have constantly grafted the strangest shoots, in the hope that, while producing different fruits, they will at least blend their foliage with the venerable stock that supports them.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>439<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2635">In America, there are no nobles nor men of letters, and the people distrust the rich. So jurists form the superior political class and the most intellectual portion of society.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1073" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1073_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a> Thus, they could only lose by innovating: this adds a conservative interest to the natural taste that they have for order.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2636">If you asked me where I place the American aristocracy, I would answer without hesitating that it is not among the rich who have no common bond that gathers them together. The American aristocracy is at the lawyers’ bar and on the judges’ bench.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1074" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1074_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2637">The more you think about what happens in the United States, the more you feel persuaded that in this country the body of jurists forms the most powerful and, so to speak, the sole counterweight of democracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2638">In the United States you easily discover how appropriate the spirit of the jurist is, by its qualities, and I will say even by its faults, for neutralizing the vices inherent in popular government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2639">When the American people allow themselves to be intoxicated by their passions, or abandon themselves to the impetus of their ideas, jurists make them feel an almost invisible brake that moderates and stops them. To their democratic instincts, jurists secretly oppose their own aristocratic tendencies; to their love of novelty, the jurists’ superstitious respect for what is old; to the immensity of their designs, the jurists’ narrow views; to their disdain for rules, the jurists’ taste for forms; and to their hotheadedness, the jurists’ habit of proceeding slowly.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2640">The courts are the most visible organs that the body of jurists uses to act upon democracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2641">The judge is a jurist who, apart from the taste for order and rules that he acquired in the study of law, draws the love of stability also from his irremovability from office. His legal knowledge had already assured <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>440<span class="bracket">]</span></span> him an elevated position among his fellows; his political power really places him in a rank apart, and gives him the instincts of the privileged classes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2642">Armed with the right of declaring laws unconstitutional, an American magistrate enters constantly into public affairs.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1075" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1075_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> He cannot force the people to make laws, but at least he compels them not to be unfaithful to their own laws and to remain consistent.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2643">I am not unaware that a secret tendency exists in the United States that leads the people to reduce the judicial power; in most of the particular state constitutions, the government, at the request of two legislative houses, can remove judges from the bench. Certain constitutions make the members of the courts <span class="ital">elective</span> and submit them to frequent reelection.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1077" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1077_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a> I dare to predict that sooner or later these innovations will have harmful results and that one day you will see that by diminishing the independence of the magistrates in this way you have attacked not only the judicial power but also the democratic republic itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2644">It must not be believed, moreover, that in the United States the spirit of the jurist is enclosed only within the courtrooms; it extends well beyond.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2645">Jurists, forming the only enlightened class that the people do not distrust, are naturally called to occupy most of the public offices. They fill the legislatures and are at the head of administrations, so they exercise a great influence on the formation of the law and on its execution. Jurists are obliged, however, to yield to the current of political opinion that carries them along; but it is easy to find indications of what they would do if they were free. The Americans, who have innovated so much in their political laws, have introduced only slight changes, and with great difficulty, into their civil laws, although several of these laws are strongly repugnant to their social state.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1078" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1078_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a> That is because in matters of civil law the majority is <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>441<span class="bracket">]</span></span> always obliged to rely on jurists; and the American jurists, left to their own choice, do not innovate.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2646">It is a very strange thing for a Frenchman to hear the complaints that arise in the United States against the jurists’ stationary spirit and their prejudices in favor of what is established.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2647">The influence of the spirit of the jurist extends still farther than the precise limits that I have just traced.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1079" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1079_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2648">There is hardly any political question in the United States that sooner or later does not turn into a judicial question. From that, the obligation that the parties find in their daily polemics to borrow ideas and language from the judicial system. Since most public men are or have formerly been jurists, they make the habits and the turn of ideas that belong to jurists pass into the handling of public affairs. The jury ends up by familiarizing all classes with them. Thus, judicial language becomes, in a way, the common language; so the spirit of the jurist, born inside the schools and courtrooms, spreads little by little beyond their confines; it infiltrates all of society, so to speak; it descends to the lowest ranks, and the entire people finishes by acquiring a part of the habits and tastes of the magistrate.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2649">In the United States, the jurists form a power that is little feared, that is scarcely noticed, that has no banner of its own, that yields with flexibility to the exigencies of time and gives way without resistance to all the movements of the social body. But this power envelops the entire society, penetrates <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>442<span class="bracket">]</span></span> into each of the classes that compose society, works on society in secret, acts constantly on society without society’s knowledge and ends by shaping society according to its desires.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2651">Since my subject has led me naturally to talk about the judicial system in the United States, I will not abandon this matter without dealing with the jury.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>443<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2652">Two things must be distinguished: the jury as a judicial institution and as a political institution.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2653">If it was a matter of knowing to what extent the jury, and above all the jury in civil matters, serves the good administration of justice, I would admit that its usefulness could be contested.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2654">The institution of the jury was born in a society that was little advanced, where hardly anything was submitted to the courts except simple questions of fact; and it is not a simple task to adapt the jury to the needs of a very civilized people, when the relationships among men are singularly multiplied and have taken on a complicated and intellectual character.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1082" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1082_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2655">My principal goal, at this moment, is to envisage the political side of the jury; another path would take me away from my subject. As for the jury considered as a judicial means, I will say only two words. When the English adopted the institution of the jury, they were a half-barbaric people; they have since become one of the most enlightened nations of the globe, and their attachment to the jury has seemed to increase with their enlightenment. They emerged from their territory, and we have seen them spread across the universe. Some formed colonies; others, independent States. The body of the nation kept the king; several of the emigrants founded powerful republics. But everywhere the English equally advocated the institution of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>444<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the jury.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1083" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1083_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> They established it everywhere or hastened to reestablish it. A judicial institution that thus obtains the votes of a great people over a long succession of centuries, that is zealously reproduced at all periods of civilization, in all climates and under all forms of government cannot be contrary to the spirit of justice.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1084" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1084_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2656">[&lt;Justice is one of the first needs of men, and there is no prejudice that can stifle it for long.&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2657">But let us leave this subject. It would singularly narrow your thought to limit yourself to envisioning the jury as a judicial institution; for, if it exercises a great influence on the outcome of trials, it exercises a very much greater one on the very destinies of society. So the jury is before all else a political institution. You must always judge it from this point of view.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2658">I understand by jury a certain number of citizens taken at random and vested temporarily with the right to judge.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>445<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2659">To apply the jury to the suppression of crime appears to me to introduce into the government an eminently republican institution. Let me explain.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2660">The institution of the jury can be aristocratic or democratic, depending on the class from which you take the jurors; but it always retains a [an eminently] republican character, in that it places the real direction of society in the hands of the governed or of a portion of them, and not in the hands of those governing.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2661">Force is never more than a fleeting element of success; soon after force comes the idea of right. A government reduced to being able to reach its enemies only on the field of battle would soon be destroyed. The true sanction of political laws is therefore found in the penal laws and if the sanction is lacking, the law sooner or later loses its force. So the man who judges in a <span class="ital">criminal court</span> is really the master of society. Now, the institution of the jury puts the people themselves, or at least a class of citizens, on the judge’s bench. So the institution of the jury really puts the leadership of society into the hands of the people or of this class.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1085" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1085_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2662">In England, the jury is recruited from among the aristocratic portion of the nation. The aristocracy makes the laws, applies the laws and judges the infractions of the laws.<a href="#n016" id="n016_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">B</a> Everything is in accord: consequently England truly speaking forms an aristocratic republic. In the United States, the same system is applied to the whole people. Each American citizen is a voter and eligible for office and jury.<a href="#n017" id="n017_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">C</a> The system of the jury, such as it is understood in America, seems to me as direct and as extreme a consequence of the dogma of sovereignty of the people as universal suffrage. These are two equally powerful means to make the majority rule.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2663">All the sovereigns who have wanted to draw the sources of their power from within themselves and lead society instead of letting themselves be led by society have destroyed the institution of the jury or have enervated <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>446<span class="bracket">]</span></span> it. The Tudors imprisoned jurors who would not condemn, and Napoleon had jurors chosen by his agents.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2664">[It was the Bourbons who, in the year 1828, really reestablished among us the institution of the jury by making chance the principal arbiter of the choice of jurors. I cannot in this matter prevent myself from admiring the singular connection of events in this world. Bonaparte, who pretended to hold his right from the national will, made a law directly contrary to the sovereignty of the people, and the Bourbons, who said they held their right from themselves, returned the sanction to the hands of the people.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1086" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1086_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2665">The law of 1828 was, without the knowledge of those who passed it, an immense advance<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1087" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1087_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a> made toward republican institutions in France. You would have noticed it clearly if the Restoration had not rushed headlong into an abyss. The jury thus emancipated would have been sufficient to bind the government little by little to the desires of the middle classes without having had the need to resort to force, because the majority of jurors was always found among the middle classes.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2666">However evident most of the preceding truths may be, they do not strike all minds, and often, among us, there still seems to be only a confused idea of the institution of the jury. If someone wants to know what elements should make up the list of jurors, the discussion is limited to considering the enlightenment and capacity of those called to be a part of the list, as if it was only a matter of a judicial institution. In truth, that seems to me to be preoccupied with the least portion of the subject. The jury is before all else a political institution; it should be considered as a mode of sovereignty of the people; it must be entirely rejected when you rule out the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>447<span class="bracket">]</span></span> sovereignty of the people, or must be put in harmony with the other laws that establish this sovereignty. The jury forms the part of the nation charged with ensuring the execution of the laws, as the legislative houses are the part of the nation charged with making the laws; and for society to be governed in a fixed and uniform manner, it is necessary that the list of jurors be expanded or restricted with the list of voters. This is the point of view that, in my opinion, must always attract the principal attention of the legislator. The rest is so to speak secondary.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2667">I am so persuaded that the jury is before all else a political institution that I still consider it in this way when it is applied to civil matters. [This can seem extraordinary at first glance. Here are my reasons for doing so.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2668">Laws are always shaky as long as they do not rely on mores; mores form the only resistant and enduring power among a people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2669">When the jury is reserved for criminal affairs, the people see it act only from time to time and in particular cases; they get used to doing without the jury in the ordinary course of life, and they consider it as a means and not as the only means for obtaining justice.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1088" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1088_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2670">When, on the contrary, the jury is extended to civil affairs, its application comes into view at every moment; then it touches all interests; each person comes to contribute to its action; in this way it enters into the customs of life; it bends the human spirit to its forms and merges so to speak with the very idea of justice.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2671">So the institution of the jury, limited to criminal affairs, is always at risk; once introduced into civil matters, it stands up against time and the efforts of men. If you had been able to remove the jury from the mores of the English as easily as from their laws, the jury would have completely succumbed under the Tudors. So it is the civil jury that really saved the liberties of England.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2672">In whatever manner you apply the jury, it cannot fail to exercise a great <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>448<span class="bracket">]</span></span> influence on the national character, but this influence increases infinitely the more you introduce it into civil matters.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2673">The jury, and above all the civil jury, serves to give the mind of all citizens a part of the habits of mind of the judge; and these habits are precisely those that best prepare the people to be free.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2674">It spreads in all classes respect for the thing judged and for the idea of right. Remove these two things, and the love of independence will be nothing but a destructive passion.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2675">It teaches men the practice of equity. Each person, by judging his neighbor, thinks that he can be judged in his turn. That is above all true of the jury in civil matters: there is hardly anyone who fears one day being the object of a criminal proceeding; but everyone can have a civil trial.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2676">The jury teaches each man not to retreat from responsibility for his own actions; a manly disposition, without which there is no political virtue.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2677">It vests each citizen with a sort of magistracy; it makes all feel that they have duties to fulfill toward society and that they enter into its government. By forcing men to get involved in something other than their own affairs, it combats individual egoism, which is like the rust of societies [{that ruins nations more than armies do}].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2678">The jury serves unbelievably to form the judgment and to augment the natural enlightenment of the people. That, in my opinion, is its greatest advantage. You must consider it as a free school, always open, where each juror comes to be instructed about his rights, where he enters into daily communication with the most learned and most enlightened members of the upper classes, where the laws are taught to him in a practical way, and are put within the reach of his intelligence by the efforts of the lawyers, the advice of the judge and the very passions of the parties. I think that the practical intelligence and good political sense of the Americans must be attributed principally to the long use that they have made of the jury in civil matters.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2679">I do not know if the jury is useful to those who have legal proceedings, but I am sure that it is very useful to those who judge them. I regard it as one of the most effective means that a society can use for the education of the people.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>449<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2680">What precedes applies to all nations; but here is what is special to the Americans, and in general to democratic peoples.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2681">I said above that in democracies the jurists, and among them the magistrates, form the only aristocratic body that can moderate the movements of the people. This aristocracy is vested with no physical power; it exercises its conservative influence only over minds. Now, it is in the institution of the civil jury that it finds the principal sources of its power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2682">In criminal trials, where society struggles against a man, the jury is led to see in the judge the passive instrument of the social power, and it distrusts his advice. Moreover, criminal trials rest entirely on simple facts that good sense easily comes to appreciate. On this ground, judge and juror are equal.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2683">It is not the same in civil trials; then the judge appears as a disinterested arbiter between the passions of the parties. The jurors view him with confidence, and they listen to him with respect; for here his intelligence entirely dominates theirs. He is the one who lays out before them the diverse arguments that have fatigued their memory and who takes them by the hand to lead them through the twists and turns of procedure; he is the one who confines them to the point of fact and teaches them the answer that they must give to the question of law. His influence over them is almost without limits.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2684">Is it necessary to say finally why I am so little moved by arguments drawn from the incapacity of jurors in civil matters?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2685">In civil trials, at least whenever it is not a matter of questions of fact, the jury has only the appearance of a judicial body.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2686">The jurors deliver the decision that the judge has rendered. They lend to this decision the authority of the society that they represent and he, the authority of reason and the law.<a href="#n018" id="n018_ref" class="footnote-link type-endnote">D</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2687">In England and in America, judges exercise an influence over the fate of criminal trials that the French judge has never known. It is easy to understand the reason for this difference: the English or American magistrate has established his power in civil matters; afterward he is only exercising it in another theater; he is not gaining it there.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2688">There are cases, and they are often the most important ones, where the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>450<span class="bracket">]</span></span> American judge has the right to deliver a verdict alone.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1089" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1089_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a> He then finds himself, by happenstance, in the position where the French judge usually finds himself; but his moral power is very much greater: the memories of the jury still follow him, and his voice has almost as much power as that of the society of which the jurors were the organ.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2689">His influence extends even well beyond the courtroom: in the diversions of private life as in the labors of political life, in the public square as within the legislatures, the American judge constantly finds around him men who are used to seeing in his intelligence something superior to their own; and, after being exercised in trials, his power makes itself felt in all the habits of mind and even on the very souls of those who have participated with him in judging.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2690">So the jury, which seems to diminish the rights of the magistracy, really establishes its dominion, and there is no country where judges are as powerful as those where the people share their privileges.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2691">With the aid of the jury in civil matters, above all, the American magistracy makes what I have called the spirit of the jurist enter into the lowest ranks of society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2692">Thus the jury, which is the most energetic means to make the people rule, is also the most effective means to teach them to rule.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1090" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1090_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>

Some are known, others are easy to make known: I will limit myself to explaining the principal ones.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2703">The Americans do not have neighbors,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1097" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1097_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a> consequently no great wars, financial crisis, ravages, nor conquest to fear; they need neither heavy taxes nor a numerous army, nor great generals; they have almost nothing to fear from a plague more terrible for republics than all the others put together, military glory.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2704">How to deny the incredible influence that military glory exercises on the spirit of the people? General Jackson, whom the Americans have twice chosen to put at their head, is a man of violent character and middling capacity; nothing in all the course of his career had ever proved that he had the qualities necessary to govern a free people; consequently, the majority of the enlightened classes of the Union have always been opposed to him. So who put him in the President’s seat and still keeps him there? The memory of a victory won by him, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans; now, this victory of New Orleans is a very ordinary feat of arms which cannot be of much interest for long except in a country where no battles are fought; and the people who allow themselves to be thus carried away <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>454<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by the prestige of glory is, certainly, the coldest, most calculating, least military and, if I can put it this way, the most prosaic of all the peoples of the world.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1098" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1098_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a><a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1099" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1099_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2705">America has no large capital<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1100" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1100_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> whose direct or indirect influence is felt over the whole extent of the territory; I consider this one of the first causes for maintaining republican institutions in the United States.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1101" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1101_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a> In cities, you can hardly prevent men from consulting each other, from getting worked <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>455<span class="bracket">]</span></span> up together, from making sudden and impassioned resolutions. Cities form like great assemblies of which all the inhabitants are members. The people exercise a prodigious influence over their magistrates there, and often the people execute their will there without intermediary.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2706">So to subject the provinces to the capital is to put the destiny of the whole empire, not only in the hands of a portion of the people, which is unjust, but also to put it in the hands of the people acting by themselves, which is very dangerous. So the preponderance of capitals strikes a grave blow at the representative system. It makes modern republics succumb to the fault of the ancient republics which all perished from not knowing this system.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2707">It would be easy for me to enumerate here a great number of other secondary causes that have favored the establishment and assure the maintenance of the democratic republics in the United States. But in the middle of this host of fortunate circumstances, I see two principal ones, and I hasten to point them out.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2708">I have already said previously that I saw in the origin of the Americans, in what I called their point of departure, the first and most effective of all the causes to which the present prosperity of the United States could be attributed. The Americans have had the good fortune of birth in their favor: long ago their fathers imported to the land that they inhabit equality of conditions and intellectual equality, from which the democratic republic was bound to emerge one day as if from its natural source. This is still not all; with a republican social state, they passed on to their descendants the habits, ideas and mores most appropriate to make the republic flourish. When I think about what this original fact produced, I seem to see the whole destiny of America contained in the first Puritan who reached its shores, like the whole human race in the first man.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2709">Among the fortunate circumstances that also have favored the establishment and assure the maintenance of the democratic republic in the United States, the first in importance is the choice of the country itself that the Americans inhabit. Their fathers gave them the love of equality and liberty, but it is God who, by giving them an unlimited continent, granted them the means to remain equal and free for a long time.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1102" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1102_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>456<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2710">General well-being favors the stability of all governments, but particularly of democratic government, which rests upon the dispositions of the greatest number, and principally on the dispositions of those who are the most exposed to needs. When the people govern, they must be happy so that they do not overturn the State. Misery produces among them what ambition does among kings. Now, causes that are material and independent of the laws and that can lead to well-being are more numerous in America than they have been in any country in the world, in any period of history. [In Europe the culmination of good laws is to produce well-being; in America all the work of bad laws would scarcely succeed in preventing well-being from being produced.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2711">In the United States, it is not only legislation that is democratic; nature itself works for the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2712">Where to find, in the memory of man, anything resembling what is happening before our eyes in North America?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2713">The famous societies of antiquity were all founded in the midst of enemy peoples who had to be conquered for those societies to be established in their place. Modern peoples have found in several parts of South America vast countries inhabited by peoples who were less enlightened than they, but who had already appropriated the soil by cultivating it. To establish their new States, they had to destroy or subjugate large populations, and they made civilization ashamed of their triumphs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2714">But North America was inhabited only by wandering tribes who did not think of using the natural riches of the soil. North America was still, properly speaking, a vacant continent, a deserted land, that awaited inhabitants.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2715">Everything is extraordinary among the Americans, their social state as well as their laws; but what is still more extraordinary is the land that holds them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2716">When the earth was given to men by the Creator, it was young and inexhaustible,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1103" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1103_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a> but they were weak and ignorant; and when they had learned to take advantage of the treasures that it held in its bosom, they already <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>457<span class="bracket">]</span></span> covered the face of the land, and soon they had to fight to gain the right to have a refuge and to dwell in liberty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2717">That is when North America comes into sight, as if God had held it in reserve and it had only just emerged from the waters of the flood.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2718">It presents, as at the first days of creation, rivers whose sources do not run dry, green and moist wildernesses, limitless fields not yet broken by the farmer’s plow. In this state, it is no longer offered to the isolated, ignorant and barbaric man of the earliest ages, but to the man already master of the most important secrets of nature, united with his fellows, and educated by an experience of fifty centuries.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2719">At the moment I speak, thirteen million civilized Europeans are spreading tranquilly across fertile wilderness areas whose resources or extent they do not yet exactly know. Three or four thousand soldiers push before them the wandering race of natives; behind the armed men, woodsmen advance who pierce the forests, drive away the wild game, explore the course of rivers and prepare the triumphant march of civilization across the wilderness.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2720">Often, in the course of this work, I have alluded to the material well-being that the Americans enjoy; I have pointed it out as one of the great causes for the success of their laws. This reason had already been given by a thousand others before me: it is the only one that, falling in a way within the awareness of the Europeans, has become popular among us. So I will not expand upon a subject so often treated and so well understood; I will only add several new facts.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1104" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1104_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2721">It is generally imagined that the wilderness of America is populated with the help of European emigrants who arrive each year on the shores of the New World, while the American population increases and multiplies on the soil that their fathers occupied: that is a great error. The European who reaches the United States arrives there without friends and often without resources; to live, he is forced to hire out his services, and it is rare to see him go beyond the large industrial zone that extends along the ocean. You <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>458<span class="bracket">]</span></span> cannot clear the wilderness without capital or credit;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1105" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1105_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> before risking yourself in the middle of the forest, the body must become accustomed to the rigors of a new climate. So it is the Americans who, daily abandoning the place of their birth, go to create for themselves vast domains far away. Thus the European leaves his cottage to go to inhabit the transatlantic shores, and the American, who is born on these very shores, disappears in turn into the emptiness of the central part of America. This double movement of emigration never stops: it begins in the heart of Europe, it continues across the great ocean, it keeps on across the solitude of the New World. Millions of men march at the same time toward the same point of the horizon: their language, their religion, their mores differ, their goal is shared. They have been told that fortune is found somewhere toward the West, and they go in haste to find it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1106" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1106_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a> [What are they going to do, in what precise place must they stop? They themselves do not know, but they march forward guided by the hand of God.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2722">Nothing can be compared with this continual displacement of the human species, except perhaps what happened at the fall of the Roman Empire. Then, as today, you saw men rush all in a throng toward the same point and meet turbulently in the same places; but the designs of Providence were different. [Then God wanted to destroy; today He wants to create.] Each new arrival brought in his train destruction and death; today each of them carries with him a seed of prosperity and life.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2723">The distant consequences of this migration of the Americans toward the West is still hidden from us by the future, but the immediate results are easy to recognize: because one part of the former inhabitants moves each year away from the states where they were born, these states, as they grow older, are becoming populated only very slowly; thus in Connecticut, which still numbers only fifty-nine inhabitants per square mile, the population has only grown by a quarter during the past forty years, while in England it has increased by a third during the same period. So the emigrant from Europe always arrives in a country half-full where industry needs hands; he <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>459<span class="bracket">]</span></span> becomes a worker who is well-off; his son goes to find his fortune in an empty country and becomes a wealthy landowner. The first amasses the capital that the second turns to good account, and there is no poverty either among the foreigners or among the natives.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2724">Legislation, in the United States, favors as much as possible the division of property; but a cause more powerful than legislation prevents property from dividing too much.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1107" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1107_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> You can see it clearly in the states that are finally beginning to fill up. Massachusetts is the most populated country in the Union; the inhabitants number eighty per square mile, which is infinitely fewer than in France, where there are one hundred sixty-two gathered in the same space.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2725">In Massachusetts, however, it is quite rare that small estates are divided: the eldest generally takes the land; the younger go to find their fortune in the wilderness.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2726">The law abolished the right of primogeniture; but you can say that Providence reestablished it without anyone having to complain, and this time at least it does not offend justice.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2727">You will judge by a single fact the prodigious number of individuals who leave New England in this way to go to move their homes into the wilderness. We are assured that in 1830, among the members of Congress, there were thirty-six who were born in the small state of Connecticut. So the population of Connecticut, which forms only one forty-third of that of the United States, provides one-eighth of the representatives.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1108" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1108_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2728">The state of Connecticut itself, however, sends only five representatives to Congress: the thirty-one others appear there as representatives of the new states of the West. If these thirty-one individuals had remained in Connecticut, it is probable that instead of being rich landowners, they would have remained small farmers and lived in obscurity without being able to open a political career, and that, far from becoming useful legislators, they would have been dangerous citizens</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>460<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2729">These considerations do not escape the mind of the Americans any more than ours.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2730">Chancellor Kent writes in his <span class="ital">Commentaries on American Law</span> (vol. IV, p. 380):</p>
<div class="cit">
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2731">It cannot be doubted that the division of property will produce great evils when it is carried to the extreme; to the extent that each portion of land can no longer provide for the support of a family; but these disadvantages have never been felt in the United States, and many generations will pass before they are felt. The immense area of our uninhabited territory, the abundance of adjacent lands and the continual flow of emigration that, departing from the shores of the Atlantic, goes constantly into the interior of the country, are sufficient and will be sufficient to prevent the breaking up of inherited lands for a long time yet to come.</p>
</div>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2732">It would be difficult to portray the greediness with which the American throws himself on this immense prize that fortune offers him. To pursue it he fearlessly defies the Indian’s arrow and the diseases of the wilderness; the silence of the woods holds nothing that astonishes him, the approach of ferocious beasts does not rouse him; a stronger passion than love of life constantly spurs him on. Before him extends a continent nearly without limits, and you would say that, already afraid of having no room there, he hurries for fear of arriving too late. I spoke about the emigration from the old states, but what will I say about that from the new? Not fifty years ago Ohio was founded; most of its inhabitants were not born there; its capital has not existed thirty years, and an immense expanse of uninhabited country still covers its territory; the population of Ohio, however, has already started to march again toward the West; most of those who come into the fertile prairies of Illinois are inhabitants of Ohio. These men have left their first home to be comfortable; they leave the second to be still better off: nearly everywhere, they find fortune, but not happiness. Among them, the desire for well-being has become a restless and ardent passion that grows as it is being satisfied. Formerly they broke the ties that bound them to their birthplace; they have formed no other ties since. For them, emigration began as a need; today, it has become in their eyes a kind of game of chance, which they love for the emotions as much as for the gain.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>461<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2733">Sometimes man moves so quickly that the wilderness reappears behind him. The forest has only bent under his feet; the moment he passes, it rises up again. It is not unusual, while traveling through the new states of the West, to encounter abandoned dwellings in the middle of the woods; often you find the ruins of a cabin in the deepest solitude, and you are amazed while crossing rough-hewn clearings that attest simultaneously to human power and inconstancy. Among these abandoned fields, over these day old ruins, the ancient forest does not delay growing new shoots; the animals retake possession of their realm; nature comes happily to cover the vestiges of man with green branches and flowers and hastens to make the ephemeral trace of man disappear.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2734">I remember that while crossing<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1109" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1109_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a> one of the uninhabited districts that still cover the state of New York, I reached the shores of a lake entirely surrounded by forests as at the beginning of the world. A small island arose in the middle of the water. The woods that covered it, spreading their foliage, entirely hid its banks. On the shores of the lake, nothing announced the presence of man; you noticed only a column of smoke on the horizon that, going straight up into the clouds above the top of the trees, seemed to hang from rather than rise into the sky.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2735">An Indian canoe was pulled onto the sand. I took advantage of it to go to visit the island that had first attracted my attention and soon after I reached its shore. The entire island formed one of those delightful uninhabited places of the New World that almost make civilized men feel nostalgia for savage life. A vigorous vegetation proclaimed by its wonders the incomparable fertility of the soil. As in all the wildernesses of North America, a profound silence reigned that was interrupted only by the monotonous cooing of the woodpigeons or by the blows that the woodpecker struck on the bark of the trees. I was very far from believing that this place had formerly been inhabited, nature there seemed so left to itself; but upon reaching the center of the island, I suddenly thought that I had found vestiges of man. Then I carefully examined all the objects in the area, and soon <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>462<span class="bracket">]</span></span> I no longer doubted that a European had come to find a refuge in this place. But how his work had changed appearance! The woods that, long ago, he had hastily cut down to make himself a shelter had since grown shoots; his fence had become living hedges, and his cabin had been transformed into a grove. In the middle of these bushes you still saw a few stones blackened by fire, scattered around a small pile of ashes; undoubtedly this was the place of the hearth: the chimney, collapsing, had covered it with debris. For some time I admired in silence the resources of nature and the weakness of man; and when finally I had to leave these enchanted places, I again repeated with sadness: What! Ruins already!<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1110" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1110_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2736">In Europe we are used to regarding as a great social danger restlessness of spirit, immoderate desire for wealth, extreme love of independence. These are precisely all the things that guarantee a long and peaceful future to the American republic. Without these restless passions, the population would concentrate around certain places and, as among us, would soon experience needs difficult to satisfy. How fortunate a country is the New World, where the vices of man are nearly as useful to society as his virtues!</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2737">This exercises a great influence on the way in which human actions are judged in the two hemispheres. Often the Americans call praiseworthy industry what we name love of gain, and they see a certain cowardice of heart in what we consider moderation of desires.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2738">In France, simplicity of tastes, tranquillity of mores, spirit of family and love of birthplace are regarded as great guarantees of tranquillity and happiness for the State; but in America, nothing seems more prejudicial to society than such virtues. The French of Canada, who have faithfully preserved the traditions of the old mores, already find it difficult to live in their territory, and this small group of people just born will soon be prey to the miseries of old nations. In Canada, the men who have the most enlightenment, patriotism and humanity, make extraordinary efforts to give the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>463<span class="bracket">]</span></span> people a distaste for the simple happiness that is still enough for them. These men celebrate the advantages of wealth, just as among us they would perhaps praise the charms of honest mediocrity, and they take more care to incite human passions than is taken elsewhere to calm such passions. Nothing in their eyes merits more praises than to exchange the pure and tranquil pleasures presented by the native country to the poor man for the sterile enjoyments provided by well-being under a foreign sky; to flee the paternal hearth and the fields where his ancestors rest; to abandon the living and the dead in order to run after fortune.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2739">In our time, America offers men resources always greater than the industry that develops those resources can be.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2740">So in America, you cannot provide enough enlightenment; for all enlightenment, at the same time that it can be useful to whoever possesses it, still turns to the profit of those who do not. New needs are not to be feared there, because all needs are satisfied without difficulty. You do not have to fear giving birth to too many passions, because all passions find an easy and salutary means of satisfaction. You cannot make men too free, because they are almost never tempted to make bad use of liberty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2741">The American republics of today are like companies of merchants formed to exploit in common the uninhabited lands of the New World and occupied with a prospering commerce.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2742">The passions that most profoundly agitate the Americans are commercial passions and not political passions, or rather they carry into politics the habits of business. They love order, without which business cannot prosper, and they particularly prize regularity of mores, which lays the foundation of good business establishments; they prefer good sense, which creates great fortunes, to genius, which often dissipates them; general ideas frighten their minds, accustomed to positive calculations, and among the Americans, practice is more honored than theory.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2743">You must go to America to understand what power material well-being<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1111" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1111_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a> exercises over political actions and even over opinions themselves, which should be subject only to reason. It is among foreigners that you principally <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>464<span class="bracket">]</span></span> discover the truth of this. Most of the emigrants from Europe bring to the New World the wild love of independence and change that is so often born out of the midst of our miseries. I sometimes met in the United States some of those Europeans who formerly had been forced to flee their country because of their political opinions. All astonished me by their speeches; but I was struck by one of them more than any other. As I crossed one of the most distant districts of Pennsylvania, night surprised me, and I went to ask for shelter at the door of a wealthy planter: he was a Frenchman. He made me sit down beside his hearth, and we began to talk freely, as happens to men who find themselves in the depths of the forest two thousand leagues from the country where they were born. I was not unaware that forty years ago my host had been a great leveler and an ardent demagogue. His name was known to history.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1112" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1112_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2744">So I was strangely surprised to hear him discuss the right of property as an economist, I was almost going to say a landholder, would be able to do; he spoke of the necessary hierarchy that fortune establishes among men, of obedience to established law, of the influence of good mores in republics, of the aid that religious ideas lend to order and to liberty: he even cited as if by accident, in support of one of his political opinions, the authority of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2745">While listening to him, I wondered at the weakness of human reason. Something is either true or false; how to find out amid the uncertainties of knowledge and the diverse lessons of experience? A new fact arises that relieves all my doubts. I was poor, now I am rich; if at least well-being, while acting upon my conduct, left my judgment free! But no, my opinions have indeed changed with my fortune, and in the happy outcome from which I profit, I have really discovered the decisive reason that I had lacked until then.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2746">Well-being exercises an influence still more freely over the Americans than over foreigners. The American has always seen before his eyes order and public prosperity linked together and marching in step, he does not imagine that they can live separately; so he has nothing to forget, and, unlike <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>465<span class="bracket">]</span></span> so many Europeans, does not need to lose what he retains from his first education.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2747">[Political society, however, is constantly agitated in the United States. But the movement is slow and measured. It influences the details and not the whole of public fortune. It bears more upon men than upon principles. You want to improve constantly, but are afraid of upsetting things; and while desiring the best, you are even more afraid of the worst.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2748">What could I add to succeed in making my thought understood? What occurred to so many of the French republicans under the Empire and to some of the liberals of today happens to the <span class="ital">majority</span> of men in America. They find in the end that society does well, or nearly so, because they are doing well.]</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2750">[≠The second general cause that I pointed out as serving to maintain the political institutions of the Americans is found in the very goodness of these institutions, that is to say in their conformity to the social state and physical position.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2751">The principal goal of this book was to make the laws of the United States known; if this goal has been reached, the reader has already been able to judge for himself which ones, among these laws, tend really to maintain the democratic republic and which ones put it in danger. If I have not succeeded in the whole course of this book, I will succeed even less in this chapter.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2752">So I do not want to pursue the course that I have already covered, and a few lines must suffice for me to summarize.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2753">Three causes seem to contribute more than all the others to maintaining the democratic republic in the New World:</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2754">The first is the federal form that the Americans adopted, and that allows <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>466<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the Union to enjoy the power of a large republic and the security of a small one.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2755">I find the second in the town institutions that, by moderating<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1113" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1113_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a> the despotism of the majority, give the people at the same time the taste for liberty and the art of being free.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2756">The third is found in the constitution of the judicial power. I have shown how much the courts serve to correct the errors of democracy and how, without ever being able to stop the movements of the majority, they succeed in slowing and directing them.</p>
</div>
<div id="lf1593-01_div_127" class="type-section">
<h2 id="lf1593-01_head_127">Of the Influence of Mores on Maintaining the Democratic Republic in the United States</h2>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2757">I said above that I considered the mores as one of the great general causes to which maintaining the democratic republic in the United States can be attributed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2758">I understand the expression <span class="ital">mores</span> here in the sense that the ancients attached to the word <span class="ital">mores;</span> I apply it not only to mores strictly speaking, which could be called habits of the heart, but to the different notions that men possess, to the diverse opinions that are current among them, and to the ensemble of ideas from which the habits of the mind are formed.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1114" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1114_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2763">Most of English America was populated by men who, after escaping from the authority of the Pope, submitted to no religious supremacy; so they brought to the New World a Christianity that I cannot portray better than by calling it democratic and republican: this will singularly favor the establishment of the republic and of democracy in public affairs. From the onset, politics and religion found themselves in accord, and they have not ceased to be so since.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2764">About fifty years ago Ireland began to pour a Catholic population into the United States. For its part, American Catholicism made converts.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1118" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1118_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a> Today in the Union you find more than a million Christians who profess the truths of the Roman Church.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2765">These Catholics show a great fidelity to the observances of their religion, and are full of ardor and zeal for their beliefs; however, they form the most republican and most democratic class that exists in the United States. This fact is a surprise at first glance, but reflection easily discloses the hidden causes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2766">[Christianity, even when it demands passive obedience in matters of dogma, is still of all religious doctrines the one most favorable to liberty, because it appeals only to the mind and heart of those whom it wants to bring into subjection.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1119" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1119_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a> No religion has so disdained the use of physical force as the religion of J[esus (ed.)].

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2767">I will say something analogous concerning equality.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2768">Of all religious doctrines, Christianity, whatever interpretation you give it, is also the one most favorable to equality. Only the religion of J[esus (ed.)]. C[hrist (ed.)]. has placed the sole grandeur of man in the accomplishment of duties, where each person can attain it; and has been pleased to consecrate poverty and hardship, as something nearly divine.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2769">I will add that among the different Christian doctrines, Catholicism seems to me one of the least contrary to the leveling of conditions.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2770">I think that it is wrong to regard the Catholic religion as a natural enemy of democracy. Among the different Christian doctrines, Catholicism seems to me on the contrary one of the most favorable to equality of conditions. Among Catholics, religious society is composed of only two elements: priest and people. The priest alone rises above the faithful; everything is equal below him.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1121" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1121_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2771">In matters of dogma, Catholicism places all minds on the same level; it subjects to the details of the same beliefs the learned as well as the ignorant, the man of genius as well as the common man; it imposes the same observances on the rich as on the poor, inflicts the same austerities on the powerful as on the weak; it compromises with no mortal, and by applying the same measure to each human being, it loves to mix all classes of society together at the foot of the same altar, as they are mixed together in the eyes of God.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2772">So, if Catholicism disposes the faithful to obedience, it does not prepare them for inequality. I will say the opposite about Protestantism,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1122" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1122_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> which, in general, carries men much less toward equality than toward independence.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1123" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1123_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>470<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2773">Catholicism is like an absolute monarchy. Remove the prince, and conditions there are more equal than in republics.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1124" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1124_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2774">The Catholic priest has often come out of the sanctuary to enter into society as a power, and he has come to take a seat amid the social hierarchy; sometimes he then used his religious influence to assure the lasting existence of a political order of which he is part. Then you could see Catholics as partisans of aristocracy by spirit of religion.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2775">But once priests are excluded or withdraw from government, as they are in the United States, there are no men who, by their beliefs, are more disposed than Catholics to carry the idea of equality of conditions into the political world.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2776">So if Catholics in the United States are not strongly led by the nature of their beliefs toward democratic and republican opinions, at least they are not naturally against them, and their social position, as well as their small number, makes it a rule for them to embrace those opinions.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1125" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1125_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2777">Most Catholics are poor, and they need all citizens to govern in order to reach the government themselves. Catholics are in the minority, and they need all rights to be respected in order to be assured of the free exercise of theirs. These two causes push them, even without their knowledge, toward <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>471<span class="bracket">]</span></span> political doctrines that they would perhaps adopt with less ardor if they were rich and predominant.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2778">The Catholic clergy in the United States have not tried to struggle against this political tendency; they seek instead to justify it. Catholic priests in America have divided the intellectual world into two parts: in one, they left revealed dogmas, and there they submit without discussion; in the other, they put political truth, and there they think that God abandoned political truth to the free search of men. Thus, Catholics in the United States are simultaneously the most submissive faithful and the most independent citizens [that there are in the world].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2779">So you can say that in the United States not a single religious doctrine shows itself hostile to democratic and republican institutions. All the clergy there use the same language; [≠and while American publicists make all the miseries of society flow from despotism and inequality of conditions, priests represent despotism and inequality of conditions as the most fertile sources of moral evil≠] opinions there are in agreement with laws, and only one current so to speak rules the human mind.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2780">I was living for a short while in one of the largest cities of the Union when I was invited to attend a political meeting the goal of which was to come to the aid of the Poles, and to send them arms and money.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2781">I found two or three thousand persons gathered in a vast room that had been prepared to receive them. Soon after, a priest, dressed in his ecclesiastical robes, came forward to the edge of the platform intended for the speakers. Those attending, after removing their hats, stood in silence, and he spoke in these terms:</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2782">God all-powerful! God of armies! Thou who sustained the hearts and guided the arms of our fathers when they upheld the sacred rights of their national independence; Thou who made them triumph over an odious oppression, and who granted to our people the benefits of peace and liberty; oh Lord! turn a favorable eye toward the other hemisphere; look with pity upon a heroic people who today struggle as we once did and for the defense of the same rights! Lord, who created all men on the same model, do not allow despotism to come to distort Thy work and to maintain inequality on earth.

Lord, who holds in Thy powerful hand the hearts of peoples as well as those of men, raise up allies for the sacred cause of right; make the French nation arise finally and, emerging from the sleep in which its leaders hold it, come to fight once again for the liberty of the world.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2783">O Lord! never turn Thy face from us; allow us always to be the most religious people, as well as the most free.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2784">God all-powerful, grant our prayer today; save the Poles. We ask Thee in the name of Thy beloved Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for the salvation of all men. <span class="ital">Amen.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2787">I have just shown what the direct action of religion on politics was in the United States. Its indirect action seems even more powerful to me, and it is when religion is not speaking about liberty that it best teaches the Americans the art of being free.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1126" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1126_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2788">There is an innumerable multitude of sects in the United States. All differ in the worship that must be given to the Creator, but all agree on the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>473<span class="bracket">]</span></span> duties of men toward one another. So each sect worships God in its way, but all sects preach the same morality in the name of God. If it is very useful to a man as an individual that his religion be true, it is not the same for society. Society has nothing either to fear or to hope concerning the other life; and what is most important for society is not so much that all citizens profess the true religion but that they profess a religion. All the sects in the United States are, moreover, within the great Christian unity, and the morality of Christianity is the same everywhere. [{In America there are Catholics and Protestants, but Americans profess the Christian religion.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2789">You are free to think that a certain number of Americans, in the worship they give to God, follow their habits more than their convictions. In the United States, moreover, the sovereign is religious, and consequently hypocrisy must be common; but America is still the place in the world where the Christian religion has most retained true power over souls; and nothing shows better how useful and natural religion is to man, since the country where today it exercises the most dominion is at the same time the most enlightened and most free.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2790">I said that American priests come down in a general way in favor of civil liberty, without excepting even those who do not allow religious liberty; you do not see them lend their support, however, to any political system in particular. They take care to keep out of public affairs and do not get mixed up in the schemes of the parties. So you cannot say that in the United States religion exercises an influence on laws or on the detail of political opinions, but it directs mores, and it is by regulating the family that it works to regulate the State.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2791">I do not doubt for an instant that the great severity of mores that is noticed in the United States has its primary source in beliefs. Religion there is often powerless to restrain the man amid the innumerable temptations presented by fortune. It cannot moderate in him the ardor to grow rich that comes to goad everyone, but it rules with sovereign power over the soul of the woman, and it is the woman who shapes the mores.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1127" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1127_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a> America is assuredly the country in the world in which the marriage bond is most respected, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>474<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and in which the highest and most sound idea of conjugal happiness has been conceived.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2792">In Europe, nearly all of the disorders of society are born around the domestic hearth and not far from the marital bed. That is where men conceive scorn for natural bonds and permitted pleasures, taste for disorder, restlessness of heart, instability of desires. Agitated by the tumultuous passions that have often troubled his own dwelling, the European submits only with difficulty to the legislative powers of the State. When, coming from the agitation of the political world, the American returns to the bosom of his family, he immediately encounters the image of order and peace. There, all his pleasures are simple and natural, his joys innocent and tranquil; and as he achieves happiness by the regularity of life, he easily gets used to regulating his opinions as well as his tastes.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1128" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1128_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2793">While the European seeks to escape his domestic sorrows by troubling society, the American draws from his home the love of order that he then carries into the affairs of the State.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2794">In the United States, religion regulates not only mores; it extends its dominion even to the mind.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2795">Among the Anglo-Americans, some profess Christian dogmas because they believe them; others, because they fear not appearing to believe them. So Christianity rules without obstacles, with the consent of all; as a result, as I have already said elsewhere, everything is certain and fixed in the moral world, while the political world seems abandoned to discussion and to the experiments of men. Thus the human mind never sees a limitless field before it; whatever its audacity, it feels from time to time that it must stop before insurmountable barriers. Before innovating, it is forced to accept certain primary givens, and to subject its boldest conceptions to certain forms that retard and stop it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2796">So the imagination of the Americans, in its greatest departures, has only a circumspect and uncertain movement; its ways are hampered and its <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>475<span class="bracket">]</span></span> works incomplete. These habits of restraint are found in political society and singularly favor the tranquillity of the people, as well as the continued existence of the institutions that the people have given themselves. Nature and circumstances had made out of the inhabitant of the United States an audacious man; it is easy to judge so when you see how he pursues fortune. If the mind of the Americans were free of all hindrances, you would soon find among them the boldest innovators and the most implacable logicians in the world. But the revolutionaries of America are obliged to profess publicly a certain respect for Christian morality and equity that does not allow them to violate laws easily when the laws are opposed to the execution of their designs; and if they could rise above their scruples, they would still feel checked by the scruples of their partisans. Until now no one has been found in the United States who has dared to advance this maxim: that everything is allowed in the interest of society. Impious maxim, that seems to have been invented in a century of liberty in order to legitimate all the tyrants to come. [&lt;In France a [illegible word] {man} seeks to justify this enormity by principles and facts, and he goes to take a seat in the councils of the prince.&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2797">Therefore, at the same time that the law allows the American people to do everything, religion prevents them from conceiving of everything and forbids them to dare everything.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1129" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1129_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2798">So religion, which among the Americans never directly takes part in the government of society, must be considered as the first of their political institutions; for if it does not give them the taste for liberty, it singularly facilitates their use of it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2799">It is also from this point of view that the inhabitants of the United States themselves consider religious beliefs. I do not know if all Americans have faith in their religion, for who can read the recesses of the heart? But I am sure that they believe it necessary for maintaining republican institutions. This opinion does not belong to one class of citizens or to one party, but to the whole nation; you find it among all ranks.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2800">In the United States, when a politician attacks a sect, it is not a reason <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>476<span class="bracket">]</span></span> for even the partisans of that sect not to support him; but if he attacks all sects together, each one flees from him, and he remains alone.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2801">While I was in America, a witness appeared before the assizes of the county of Chester (State of New York) and declared that he did not believe in the existence of God and in the immortality of the soul. The presiding judge refused to admit his oath, given, he said, that the witness had destroyed in advance any faith that could be given to his words.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1130" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1130_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> The newspapers reported the fact without comment.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2802">Americans mix Christianity and liberty so completely in their mind that it is nearly impossible to make them conceive one without the other; and, among them, this is not one of those sterile beliefs that the past bequeaths to the present and that seem more to vegetate deep in the soul than to live.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2803">I have seen Americans join together to send priests into the new states of the West and to found schools and churches there; they are afraid that religion may come to be lost in the middle of the woods, and that the people who are arising there may not be as free as those from whom they came. I met rich inhabitants of New England who abandoned the country of their birth with the goal of going to lay the foundations of Christianity and liberty on the banks of the Missouri or on the prairies of Illinois. This is how religious zeal in the United States constantly warms up at the hearth of patriotism. You think that these men act uniquely in consideration of the other life, but you are mistaken: eternity is only one of their concerns. If you question these missionaries of Christian civilization, you will be very surprised to hear them speak so often about the good things of this world and to find politicians where you thought to see only men of religion. “All the American republics stand together one with the others, they will say to you; if the republics of the West fell into anarchy or submitted to the yoke <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>477<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of despotism, the republican institutions that flourish on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean would be in great peril; so we have an interest that these new states are religious, in order that they allow us to remain free.”<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1131" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1131_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2804">Such are the opinions of the Americans; but their error is clear. For each day someone proves to me very learnedly that everything is good in America, except precisely this religious spirit that I admire; and I learn that the only thing missing from the liberty and happiness of the human species, on the other side of the Ocean, is to believe with Spinoza<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1132" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1132_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a> in the eternity of the world, and to uphold with Cabanis that the brain secretes thought. To that I have nothing to reply, in truth, if not that those who use this language have not been to America, and have not seen religious peoples any more than free peoples. So I will await their return.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2805">[≠For me, if something could make me despair of the destiny of Europe, it is to see the strange confusion that reigns there in minds. I see pious men who would like to suffocate liberty, as if liberty, this great privilege of man, was not a nearly holy thing. Further along, I see others who think to arrive at being free by attacking all beliefs, but I do not see any who seem to notice the tight and necessary knot that ties [v: the republic] religion to liberty.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2806">There are men in France who consider republican institutions as the temporary instrument of their grandeur. They measure with their eyes the immense gap that separates their vices and their miseries from power and riches, and they would like to pile up ruins<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1133" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1133_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a> in this abyss in order to try to fill it. These men are to liberty what the free companies of the Middle Ages were to kings; they make war on their own behalf even when they wear his colors; the republic will always live long enough to pull them out of their present low position. I am not speaking to them. But there are others who <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>478<span class="bracket">]</span></span> see in the republic a permanent and tranquil state, a necessary end toward which ideas and mores lead modern societies each day, and who would sincerely like to prepare men to be free. When these men attack religious beliefs, they follow their passions and not their interests. Despotism can do without faith, but not liberty. Religion is much more necessary in the republic that they advocate than in the monarchy that they attack, and in democratic republics more than in all others. How could society fail to perish if, while the political bond grows loose, the moral bond does not become tighter? And what to do with a people master of itself, if it is not subject to God?</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2811">I had seen among us the spirit of religion and the spirit of liberty march almost always in opposite directions. Here, I found them intimately joined the one to the other: they reigned together over the same soil.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2812">Each day I felt my desire to know the cause of this phenomenon increase.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2813">To find it out, I asked the faithful of all communions; I sought, above all, the company of priests who are the keepers of the different faiths and who have a personal interest in their continued existence. The religion I <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>480<span class="bracket">]</span></span> profess brought me particularly close to the Catholic clergy, and I did not delay in striking up a sort of intimacy with several of its members.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1138" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1138_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a> To each of them I expressed my astonishment and revealed my doubts.

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2814">This led me to examine more attentively than I had done until then the position that American priests occupy in political society. I realized with <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>481<span class="bracket">]</span></span> surprise that they fill no public position.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1139" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1139_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> I did not see a single one of them in the administration, and I discovered that they were not even represented within the assemblies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2815">The law, in several states, had closed a political career to them;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1140" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1140_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> opinion, in all the others.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2816">When finally I found out what the mind of the clergy itself was, I noticed that most of its members seemed to remove themselves voluntarily from power, and to take a kind of professional pride in remaining apart from it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2817">I heard them anathematize ambition and bad faith, whatever the political opinions that ambition and bad faith carefully used to cover themselves. But I learned, by listening to them, that men cannot be blameworthy in the eyes of God because of these very opinions, when the opinions are sincere, and that there is no more sin in being wrong in matters of government than in being mistaken about the way in which your dwelling must be built or your furrow must be plowed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2818">I saw them separate themselves with care from all parties, and flee contact with all the ardor of personal interest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2819">These facts succeeded in proving to me that I had been told the truth. Then I wanted to go back from facts to causes. I asked myself how it could happen that by diminishing the apparent strength of a religion, you <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>482<span class="bracket">]</span></span> came to increase its true power, and I believed that it was not impossible to find out.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2820">Never will the short space of sixty years enclose all of the imagination of man; the incomplete joys of this world will never be enough for his heart. Among all beings, man alone shows a natural distaste for existence and an immense desire to exist: he scorns life and fears nothingness. These different instincts constantly push his soul toward the contemplation of another world, and it is religion that leads him there. So religion is only a particular form of hope, and it is as natural to the human heart as hope itself.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1141" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1141_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a> It is by a type of mental aberration and with the help of a kind of moral violence exercised over their own nature, that men remove themselves from religious beliefs; an irresistible inclination brings them back to beliefs. Unbelief is an accident; faith alone is the permanent state of humanity.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2821">So by considering religion only from a human viewpoint, you can say that all religions draw from man himself an element of strength that they can never lack, because it is due to one of the constituent principles of human nature.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2822">I know that there are times when religion can add to this influence, which is its own, the artificial power of laws and the support of the physical powers that lead society. We have seen religions, intimately united with <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>483<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the governments of the earth, dominate souls by terror and by faith at the same time; but when a religion contracts such an alliance, I am not afraid to say, it acts as a man could: it sacrifices the future with the present in mind, and by obtaining a power that is not its due, it puts its legitimate power at risk.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2823">When a religion seeks to found its dominion only on the desire for immortality that equally torments the hearts of all men, it can aim for universality; but when it comes to unite with a government, it must adopt maxims that are applicable only to certain peoples. Therefore, by allying itself to a political power, religion increases its power over some and loses the hope of reigning over all.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2824">As long as a religion relies only on the sentiments that console all miseries, it can attract the heart of the human species. Mingled with the bitter passions of this world, religion is sometimes constrained to defend allies that have offered interest rather than love; and it must reject as adversaries men who often still love it, even as they fight those men with whom religion is united. So religion cannot share the material strength of those who govern without burdening itself with a portion of the hatreds caused by those who govern.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2825">The political powers that appear most established have as a guarantee of their continued existence only the opinions of a generation, the interests of a century, often the life of a man. A law can modify the social state that seems most definitive and most firm, and with it everything changes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2826">The powers of society are all more or less fleeting, just as our years upon the earth; they rapidly follow one another, like the various cares of life; and you have never seen a government that relied on an invariable disposition of the human heart and that was able to base itself on an immortal interest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2827">As long as a religion finds its strength in the sentiments, the instincts, the passions that are reproduced in the same way in all periods of history, it defies the effort of time, or at least it can be destroyed only by another religion. [Political powers can do nothing against it.] But when religion wants to rely on the interests of this world, it becomes almost as fragile as all the powers of the earth. Alone, religion can hope for immortality; tied <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>484<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to ephemeral powers, it follows their fortune, and often falls with the passions of the day that sustain those powers.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2828">So by uniting with different political powers, religion can only contract an onerous alliance. It does not need their help to live, and by serving them it can die.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2829">The danger that I have just pointed out exists at all times, but it is not always as visible.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2830">There are centuries when governments appear immortal, and others when you would say that the existence of society is more fragile than that of a man.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2831">Certain constitutions keep citizens in a sort of lethargic sleep, and others deliver them to a feverish agitation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2832">When governments seem so strong and laws so stable, men do not notice the danger that religion can run by uniting with power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2833">When governments prove to be so weak and laws so changeable, the peril strikes all eyes, but then there is often no more time to escape. So you must learn to see it from afar.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2834">To the extent that a nation assumes a democratic social state and you see societies lean toward the republic,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1142" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1142_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a> it becomes more and more dangerous to unite religion with authority; for the time is coming when power will pass from hand to hand, when political theories will succeed one another, when men, laws, constitutions themselves will disappear or change each day, and not for a time, but constantly. Agitation and instability stem from the nature of democratic republics, as immobility and sleep form the law of absolute monarchies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2835">If the Americans, who change the head of State every four years, who every two years choose new legislators, and replace provincial administrators every year; if the Americans, who have delivered the political world to the experiments of innovators, had not placed their religion somewhere outside of the political world, to what could they cling in the ebb and flow <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>485<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of human opinions? Amid the struggle of parties, where would the respect be that religion is due? What would become of its immortality when everything perishes around it?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2836">American priests have seen this truth before anyone else, and they model their conduct on it. They have seen that religious influence had to be renounced, if they wanted to acquire a political power, and they preferred to lose the support of power than to share its vicissitudes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2837">In America, religion is perhaps less powerful than it has been in certain times and among certain peoples, but its influence is more durable. It has reduced itself to its own forces that no one can take away from it; it acts only within a single circle, but it covers it entirely and predominates within it without effort.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2838">In Europe I hear voices that are raised on all sides; people deplore the absence of beliefs and ask how to give religion something of its former power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2839">It seems to me that we must first try attentively to find out what should be, today, the <span class="ital">natural state</span> of men in matters of religion. Then, knowing what we are able to hope and what we have to fear, we will see clearly the goal toward which our efforts must tend.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2840">Two great dangers menace the existence of religions: schisms and indifference.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2841">During centuries of fervor, men sometimes happen to abandon their religion, but they escape its yoke only to submit to the yoke of another religion. Faith changes objects; it does not die. The old religion then excites fervent love or implacable hatred in all hearts; some leave it with anger, others follow it with a new ardor: beliefs differ, irreligion is unknown.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2842">But it is not the same when a religious belief is silently undermined by doctrines that I will call negative, because while asserting the falsity of one religion they establish the truth of no other.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2843">Then prodigious revolutions take place in the human spirit, without man seeming to aid the revolutions with his passions and without suspecting them, so to speak. You see men who allow, as if by forgetfulness, the object of their most cherished hopes to escape. Carried along by an imperceptible current against which they do not have the courage to struggle, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>486<span class="bracket">]</span></span> but to which they yield with regret, they abandon the faith that they love to follow the doubt that leads them to despair.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2844">During the centuries that we have just described, you abandon your beliefs by coldness rather than by hatred; you do not reject them, they leave you. While ceasing to believe religion true, the unbeliever continues to judge it useful. Considering religious beliefs from a human aspect, he recognizes their dominion over mores, their influence over laws. He understands how they can make men live in peace and gently prepare men for death. So he regrets faith after losing it, and deprived of a good of which he knows the whole value, he is afraid to take it away from those who still possess it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2845">From his side, the one who continues to believe is not afraid to reveal his faith to all eyes. In those who do not share his hopes, he sees unfortunate men rather than adversaries; he knows that he can gain their esteem without following their example; so he is at war with no one; and not considering the society in which he lives as an arena in which religion must struggle constantly against a thousand fierce enemies, he loves his contemporaries at the same time that he condemns their weaknesses and is distressed by their errors.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2846">Those who do not believe, hiding their unbelief, and those who do believe, showing their faith, create a public opinion in favor of religion; it is loved, it is upheld, it is honored, and you must penetrate to the recesses of souls to discover the wounds that it has received.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2847">The mass of men, whom religious sentiment never abandons, then see nothing that separates them from established beliefs. The instinct of another life leads them without difficulty to the foot of altars and delivers their hearts to the precepts and consolations of faith.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2848">Why does this picture not apply to us?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2849">I notice among us men who have ceased to believe in Christianity without adhering to any religion.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2850">I see others who have halted at doubt, and already pretend to believe no more.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2851">Further along, I meet Christians who still believe and dare not say so.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2852">Amid these lukewarm friends and fiery adversaries, I finally discover a small number of the faithful ready to defy all obstacles and to scorn all dangers for their beliefs. The latter have acted contrary to human weakness <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>487<span class="bracket">]</span></span> in order to rise above common opinion. Carried away by this very effort, they no longer know precisely where they should stop. Since they have seen that, in their country, the first use that man made of independence has been to attack religion, they fear their contemporaries and withdraw with terror from the liberty that the former pursue. Since unbelief appears to them as something new, they include in the same hatred everything that is new.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1143" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1143_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a> So they are at war with their century and their country, and in each of the opinions that are professed there they see a necessary enemy of faith.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2853">Such should not be today the natural state of man in matters of religion.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2854">An accidental and particular cause is found among us that prevents the human spirit from following its inclination and pushes it beyond the limits at which it should naturally stop.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2855">I am profoundly persuaded that this particular and accidental cause is the intimate union of politics and religion.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1144" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1144_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>488<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2856">Unbelievers in Europe pursue Christians as political enemies, rather than as religious adversaries; they hate faith as the opinion of a party much more than as a mistaken belief; and in the priest they reject the representative of God less than the friend of power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2857">In Europe, Christianity allowed itself to be intimately united with the powers of the earth. Today these powers are falling and Christianity is as though buried beneath their debris. It is a living thing that someone wanted to bind to the dead: cut the ties that hold it and it will rise again.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2858">I do not know what must be done to give Christianity in Europe the energy of youth. God alone would be able to do so; but at least it depends on men to leave to faith the use of all of the forces that it still retains.</p>

<div class="opener">
<div id="lf1593-01_argument_078" class="argument">
<p class="indent-center" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2859"><span class="ital">What must be understood by the enlightenment of the American people.—The human mind has received a less profound cultivation in the United States than in Europe.—But no one has remained in ignorance.—Why.—Rapidity with which thought circulates in the half-empty states of the West.—How practical experience serves Americans even more than literary knowledge.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2860">In a thousand places in this work I have pointed out to readers what influence the enlightenment and habits of the Americans exercised on maintaining <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>489<span class="bracket">]</span></span> their political institutions. So now, few new things remain for me to say.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2861">Until now America has had only a very small number of notable writers; it does not have any great historians and does not have one poet. Its inhabitants see literature strictly understood with a kind of disfavor; and a third-rank city in Europe publishes more literary works each year than the twenty-four states of the Union taken together.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1145" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1145_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2862">The American mind withdraws from general ideas; it does not turn toward theoretical discoveries. Politics itself and industry cannot lead it there. In the United States, new laws are made constantly; but great writers are still not found to seek out the general principles of laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2863">The Americans have experts on the law and legal commentators; they lack writers on public affairs; and in politics, they give the world examples rather than lessons.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1146" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1146_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2864">It is the same for the mechanical arts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2865">In America, the inventions of Europe are applied with sagacity, and after perfecting them, they are marvelously adapted to the needs of the country. Men there are industrious, but they do not cultivate the science of industry. You find good workers and few inventors there. Fulton<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1147" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1147_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[†]</a> peddled his genius for a long time among foreign peoples before being able to devote it to his country. [So in America you find none of those great intellectual centers from which fire and light burst forth at the same time {as in Europe}. I do not know if perhaps we should thank heaven. America already carries an immense weight in the destinies of the world; and perhaps <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>490<span class="bracket">]</span></span> it only lacks great writers to overturn violently in a moment all the old societies of Europe.]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1148" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1148_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2866">So whoever wants to judge the state of enlightenment among the Anglo-Americans opens himself to seeing the same subject from two different views. If he pays attention only to the learned, he will be astonished by their small number; and if he counts the ignorant, the American people will seem to him the most enlightened on earth.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2867">The entire population is placed between these two extremes; I have already said it elsewhere.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2868">[In the United States, you find fewer great landowners and infinitely more landowners than anywhere else; less wealth and more comfort. Minds have been subjected to the same law. There scientific and literary genius is as rare as ability is common, and if you do not find great writers, everyone knows how to write. What could be the state of a few minds seems to have been divided equally among all.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2869">In New England, each citizen receives the elementary notions of human knowledge; furthermore, he learns the doctrines and the proofs of his religion; he is taught the history of his country and the principal features of the Constitution that governs it. In Connecticut and Massachusetts, it is very rare to find a man who only imperfectly knows all these things, and one who is absolutely ignorant of them is in a way a phenomenon.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1149" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1149_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2870">When I compare the Greek and Roman republics to these republics of America, the manuscript libraries of the first and their coarse populace, to the thousand newspapers that crisscross the second and to the enlightened people that inhabit the republics of America; when I then think of all the efforts that are still made to judge the one with the aid of the others and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>491<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to foresee what will happen today by what happened two thousand years ago, I am tempted to burn my books,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1150" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1150_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> in order to apply only new ideas to a social state so new.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2871">You must not indiscriminately extend to the whole Union, moreover, what I say about New England. The more you advance toward the West or toward the South, the more the instruction of the people diminishes. In the states neighboring the Gulf of Mexico, a certain number of individuals are found, as among us, to whom the elements of human knowledge are foreign; but in the United States you would seek in vain for a single district that was plunged into ignorance. The reason for it is simple: the peoples of Europe left the shadows and barbarism in order to advance toward civilization and enlightenment. Their progress was unequal; some ran along the course, others in a way only walked; still others stopped and they are still asleep along the road.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2872">It was not the same in the United States.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2873">The Anglo-Americans arrived fully civilized on the soil that their posterity occupies; they did not have to learn, it was enough for them not to forget. Now, it is the sons of these very Americans who, each year, carry into the wilderness, with their dwelling-place, knowledge already acquired and respect for learning. Education made them feel the usefulness of enlightenment and made them capable of transmitting this very enlightenment to their descendents. So in the United States, society has no childhood; it is born in manhood.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2874">The Americans make no use of the word peasant; they do not employ the word, because they do not have the idea; the ignorance of the first ages, the simplicity of the fields, the rusticity of the village, have not been preserved among them, and they imagine neither the virtues, nor the vices, nor the coarse habits, nor the innocent graces of a civilization being born.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2875">At the extreme limits of the confederated states, at the confines of society and wilderness, is a population of hardy adventurers who, in order to flee the poverty ready to strike them under the paternal roof, have not been <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>492<span class="bracket">]</span></span> afraid to plunge into the empty areas of America and seek a new country there. Having barely arrived at the place that must serve him as a refuge, the pioneer hastily cuts down a few trees and raises a cabin under the leafy branches. Nothing offers a more miserable sight than these isolated dwellings. The traveler who approaches them toward the evening notices from afar the flame of the hearth shining through the walls; and at night, if the wind comes up, he hears the roof of foliage move noisily amid the trees of the forest. Who would not believe that this poor cottage serves as a refuge for coarseness and ignorance? You must not, however, establish any correlation between the pioneer and the place that serves him as a refuge. Everything is primitive and savage around him, but he is so to speak the result of eighteen centuries of efforts and experience. He wears city clothing, speaks the language of the city, knows the past, is curious about the future, argues about the present; he is a very civilized man who, for a time, submits to living in the woods and who plunges into the wilderness of the New World with the Bible, an ax and some newspapers.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1151" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1151_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2876">It is difficult to imagine with what incredible rapidity thought circulates in the heart of these wilderness areas.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1152" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1152_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2877">I do not believe that there is as great an intellectual movement in the most enlightened and most populated districts of France.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1153" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1153_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>493<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2878">You cannot doubt that in the United States the instruction of the people serves powerfully to maintain the democratic republic. It will be so, I think, everywhere that the instruction that enlightens the mind is not separated from the education that regulates mores.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2879">Nonetheless, I do not exaggerate this advantage, and I am still far from believing, as a great number of people in Europe do, that it is sufficient to teach men to read and write to make them citizens immediately. [&lt;≠I do not consider elementary knowledge as the most potent means to educate the people; it facilitates the study of liberty for them, but it does not give them the art of being free.≠&gt;]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2880">True enlightenment arises principally from experience, and if the Americans had not been accustomed little by little to governing themselves, the book learning that they possess would not be a great help today in succeeding to do so.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2881">I have lived a great deal with the people of the United States, and I cannot say how much I have admired their experience and their good sense.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1155" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1155_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2882">Do not lead the American to speak about Europe; he will ordinarily show a great presumption and a quite foolish pride. He will be content with those general and indefinite ideas that, in all countries, are such a great help to the ignorant. But interrogate him about his country, and you will see the cloud that enveloped his mind suddenly dissipate; his language will become clear, plain and precise, like his thought. He will teach you what his rights are and what means he must use to exercise them; he will know by what practices the political world operates. You will notice that the rules of administration are known to him and that he has made himself familiar with the mechanism of the laws. The inhabitant of the United States has not <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>494<span class="bracket">]</span></span> drawn this practical knowledge and these positive notions from books; his formal education may have prepared him to receive them, but has not provided him with them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2883">It is by participating in legislation that the American learns to know the laws; it is by governing that he finds out about the forms of government. The great work of society is carried out each day before his eyes and, so to speak, by his hands.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2884">In the United States, the whole of the education of men is directed toward politics; in Europe, its principal goal is to prepare for private life. The activity of citizens in public affairs is too rare a fact to be anticipated in advance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2885">As soon as you cast your eyes on the two societies, these differences are revealed even in their external appearance.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2886">In Europe, we often bring the ideas and habits of private existence into public life, and as we happen to pass suddenly from the interior of the family to the government of the State, you often see us discuss the great interests of society in the same way we converse with our friends.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2887">In contrast, the Americans almost always carry the habits of public life into private life. Among them, the idea of the jury is found in school games, and you find parliamentary forms even in the order of a banquet.</p>

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2889">I said that maintaining democratic institutions in the United States had to be attributed to circumstances, laws and mores.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1156" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1156_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2890">Most Europeans know only the first of these three causes, and they give it a preponderant importance that it does not have.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2891">It is true that the Anglo-Americans brought equality of conditions to the New World. Never were either commoners or nobles found among them; prejudices of birth there have always been as unknown as prejudices of profession. Since the social state is therefore democratic, democracy had no difficulty establishing its dominion.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2892">But this fact is not particular to the United States; nearly all the colonies of America were founded by men equal among themselves or who became equal by inhabiting the colonies. There is not a single part of the New World where Europeans were able to create an aristocracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2893">Democratic institutions prosper only in the United States, however.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2894">The American Union has no enemies to fight. It is alone in the middle of the wilderness like an island in the heart of the Ocean.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2895">But nature had isolated in the same way the Spanish of [{Mexico, those of Peru}] South America [{the Portuguese of Brazil, the French of the Antilles, the Dutch of Guyana}], and this isolation did not prevent them from maintaining armies. They made war on each other when foreigners were lacking. Only the Anglo-American democracy, until now, has been able to remain at peace.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2896">The territory of the Union presents a limitless field to human activity; it offers an inexhaustible sustenance to industry and to work. So love of wealth takes the place of ambition there, and well-being quells the fervor of parties.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2897">But in what portion of the world do you meet more fertile wildernesses, larger rivers, more untouched and more inexhaustible riches than in South America? Yet South America cannot support democracy. If, for peoples to be happy, it was sufficient to have been placed in a corner of the universe <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>496<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and to be able to spread at will over uninhabited lands, the Spanish of South America would not have to complain about their lot. And when they would not enjoy the same happiness as the inhabitants of the United States, they would at least make the peoples of Europe envious. There are, however, no nations on the earth more miserable than those of South America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2898">Therefore, not only can physical causes not lead to analogous results among the Americans of the South and those of the North, but they cannot even produce among the first something that is not inferior to what is seen in Europe, where physical causes act in an opposite direction.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2899">So physical causes do not influence the destiny of nations as much as is supposed.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1157" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1157_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2900">I met men of New England ready to abandon a country where they would have been able to find ease and comfort, in order to go to seek their fortune in the wilderness. Nearby, I saw the French population of Canada squeeze itself into a space too small for it, when the same wilderness was near; and while the emigrant of the United States acquired a great estate at the cost of a few days of work, the Canadian paid as much for land as if he still lived in France.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2901">Thus nature, while delivering the uninhabited areas of the New World to Europeans, offers them assets that they do not always know how to use.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2902">I notice among other peoples of America the same conditions of prosperity as among the Anglo-Americans, without their laws and their mores; and these peoples are miserable. So the laws and mores of the Anglo-Americans form the special reason for their grandeur and the predominant cause that I am seeking.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2903">I am far from pretending that there is an absolute good in American laws; I do not believe that they are applicable to all democratic peoples; and, among those laws, there are several that, even in the United States, seem dangerous to me.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2904">You cannot deny, however, that the legislation of the Americans, taken <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>497<span class="bracket">]</span></span> as a whole, is well adapted to the genius of the people that it must govern and to the nature of the country.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1158" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1158_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2905">So American laws are good, and a great part of the success that the government of democracy achieves in America must be attributed to them; but I do not think that they are the principal cause. And if the laws appear to me to have more influence on the social happiness of the Americans than the very nature of the country, from another perspective I see reasons to believe that they exercise less influence than mores.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2906">The federal laws surely form the most important portion of the legislation of the United States.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2907">Mexico, which is as happily situated as the Anglo-American Union, appropriated these same laws, and it is not able to get accustomed to the government of democracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2908">So there is a reason independent of physical causes and laws that makes democracy able to govern the United States.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1159" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1159_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2909">But here is what proves it even more. Nearly all the men who inhabit the territory of the Union are born of the same blood. They speak the same language, pray to God in the same way, are subject to the same physical causes, obey the same laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2910">So what produces the differences that must be observed among them?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2911">Why, in the [{North}] East of the Union, does republican government appear strong and well-ordered, why does it proceed with maturity and deliberation? What cause marks all its acts with a character of wisdom and lasting existence?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2912">Why, in contrast, do the powers of society in the West [{and in the South}] seem to move haphazardly?</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>498<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2913">Why, in the movement of affairs, does something disorderly, passionate, you could almost say feverish, reign that does not herald a long future?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2914">I am no longer comparing the Anglo-Americans to foreign peoples; now I am contrasting the Anglo-Americans to each other, and I am seeking why they do not resemble each other. Here all arguments drawn from the nature of the country and from the difference of laws are missing at the same time. I must resort to some other cause; and where will I find this cause, if not in mores?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2915">It is in the East [{North}] that the Anglo-Americans have contracted the longest use of the government of democracy, and that they have formed habits and conceived ideas most favorable to maintaining it. [In the North] Democracy there has little by little penetrated customs, opinions, forms; you find it in all the details of social life as in the laws. It is in the East [{North}] that the book learning and the practical education of the people have been most perfected and that religion has best intermingled with liberty. What are all these habits, these opinions, these customs, these beliefs, if not what I called mores?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2916">In the West, in contrast, a part of these same advantages is still lacking. Many Americans of the states of the West are born in the woods, and they mix with the civilization of their fathers the ideas and customs of savage life. Among them, passions are more violent, religious morality less powerful, ideas less settled. Men there exercise no control over each other, for they scarcely know each other.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1160" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1160_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a> So the nations of the West show, to a certain extent, the inexperience and the unruly habits of emerging peoples. Societies in the West are formed from old elements; but the assembly is new.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1161" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1161_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>499<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2917">So mores, particularly, make the Americans of the United States, alone among all Americans, capable of supporting the dominion of democracy; and mores also make the various Anglo-American democracies more or less well-regulated and prosperous.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2918">Therefore, in Europe, the influence that the geographic position of the country exercises on the continued existence of democratic institutions is exaggerated. Too much importance is attributed to laws, too little to mores. These three great causes undoubtedly serve to regulate and to direct American democracy; but if they had to be classified, I would say that physical causes contribute less than laws, and laws infinitely less than mores.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2919">I am persuaded that the most fortunate situation and the best laws cannot maintain a constitution in spite of mores, while the latter still turn to good account the most unfavorable positions and the worst laws. The importance of mores is a common truth to which study and experience constantly lead. It seems to me that I find it placed in my mind like a central point; I see it at the end of all my ideas.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1162" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1162_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2920">I have only one more word to say on this subject.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2921">If, in the course of this work, I have not succeeded in making the reader <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>500<span class="bracket">]</span></span> feel the importance that I attributed to the practical experience of the Americans, to their habits, to their opinions, in a word, to their mores, in maintaining their laws, I have missed the principal goal that I set for myself by writing it.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2923">I said<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1163" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1163_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a> that the success of democratic institutions in the United States was due to the laws themselves and to mores more than to the nature of the country.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2924">But does it follow that these same causes alone transported elsewhere have the same power, and if the country cannot take the place of laws and mores, can laws and mores in turn take the place of the country?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2925">Here you will understand without difficulty that the elements of proof are lacking. In the New World you meet peoples other than the Anglo-Americans, and since these peoples are subject to the same physical causes as the latter, I have been able to compare them to each other.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2926">But outside of America there are no nations that, deprived of the same physical advantages as the Anglo-Americans, have still adopted their laws and their mores.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>501<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2927">Therefore we do not have a point of comparison in this matter; we can only hazard opinions.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2928">It seems to me first that the institutions of the United States must be carefully distinguished from democratic institutions in general.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2929">When I think of the state of Europe, its great peoples, its populous cities, its formidable armies, the complexities of its politics, I cannot believe that the Anglo-Americans themselves, transported with their ideas, their religion, their mores to our soil, could live there without considerably modifying their laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2930">But you can imagine a democratic people organized in a different manner from the American people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2931">Is it impossible to conceive of a government based on the real will of the majority, but in which the majority, doing violence to its natural instincts of equality, in favor of order and the stability of the State, would consent to vest a family or a man with all the attributions of the executive power? Can you not imagine a democratic society in which national forces would be more centralized than in the United States, in which the people would exercise a less direct and less irresistible dominion over general affairs, and in which, nonetheless, each citizen, vested with certain rights, would, within his sphere, take part in the working of the government?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1164" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1164_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2932">What I saw among the Anglo-Americans leads me to believe that democratic institutions of this nature, introduced prudently into society,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1165" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1165_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a> <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>502<span class="bracket">]</span></span> which would mix little by little with the habits and would gradually merge with the very opinions of the people, would be able to subsist elsewhere than in America.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1166" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1166_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2933">If the laws of the United States were the only democratic laws that could be imagined or the most perfect that it is possible to find, I understand that you could conclude that the success of the laws of the United States proves nothing for the success of democratic laws in general, in a country less favored by nature.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2934">But if the laws of the Americans seem to me defective in many points, and it is easy for me to imagine others, the special nature of the country does not prove to me that democratic institutions cannot succeed among a people where, physical circumstances being less favorable, the laws would be better.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2935">If men showed themselves to be different in America from what they are elsewhere; if their social state gave birth among them to habits and opinions contrary to those that are born in Europe from this same social state, what happens in the American democracies would teach nothing about what should happen in other democracies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2936">If the Americans showed the same tendencies as all the other democratic peoples, and their legislators resorted to the nature of the country and to the favor of circumstances in order to keep these tendencies within just <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>503<span class="bracket">]</span></span> limits, the prosperity of the United States, having to be attributed to purely physical causes, would prove nothing in favor of peoples who would like to follow their example without having their natural advantages.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1167" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1167_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2937">But neither the one nor the other of these suppositions is justified by the facts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2938">I encountered in America passions analogous to those we see in Europe. Some were due to the very nature of the human heart; others, to the democratic state of society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2939">Thus I found in the United States the restlessness of heart that is natural to man when, all conditions being more or less equal, each one sees the same chances to rise. There I encountered the democratic sentiment of envy expressed in a thousand different ways. I observed that the people often showed, in the conduct of affairs, a great blend of presumption and ignorance, and I concluded that in America, as among us, men were subject to the same imperfections and exposed to the same miseries.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2940">But when I came to examine attentively the state of society, I discovered without difficulty that the Americans had made great and happy efforts to combat these weaknesses of the human heart and to correct these natural defects of democracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2941">Their various municipal laws appeared to me as so many barriers that held within a narrow sphere the restless ambition of citizens, and turned to the profit of the town the same democratic passions that could overturn the State. It seemed to me that American legislators had managed to oppose, not without success, the idea of rights to the sentiments of envy; the im-mobility of religious morality, to the continual movements of the political world; the experience of the people, to their theoretical ignorance; and their habit of affairs, to the hotheadedness of their desires.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2942">So the Americans did not resort to the nature of the country to combat the dangers that arise from their constitution [v: social state] and from their <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>504<span class="bracket">]</span></span> political laws. To the evils that they share with all democratic peoples, they applied remedies that until now only they were aware of; and although they were the first to try them out, they succeeded.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2943">The mores and laws of the Americans are not the only ones that can be suitable for democratic peoples; but the Americans have shown that we must not despair of regulating democracy with the help of laws and mores.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2944">If other peoples, borrowing from America this general and fruitful idea, and without wishing to imitate the inhabitants of America in the particular application that they have made of this idea, attempted to adapt themselves to the social state that Providence imposes on men today, and thus sought to escape the despotism or the anarchy that threatens them, what reasons do we have to believe that they must fail in their efforts?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1168" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1168_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2945">The organization and the establishment of democracy among Christians is the great political problem of our time. The Americans undoubtedly do not solve this problem, but they provide useful lessons to those who want to solve it.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2949">I know that today there are many honest men hardly frightened by this future, who, fatigued by liberty, would love finally to rest far from its storms.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1172" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1172_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2950">But the latter know very badly the port toward which they are heading. Preoccupied by their memories, they judge absolute power by what it was formerly, and not by what it could be today. [There are differences even in despotism, as in liberty.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2951">If absolute power came to be established once again among the democratic peoples of Europe, I do not doubt that it would take a new form and would show itself with features unknown to our fathers.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2952">There was a time in Europe when the law, as well as the consent of the people, had vested kings with a power almost without limits. But they hardly ever happened to use it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2953">[They had the right rather than the practice of omnipotence.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2954">I will not talk about the prerogatives of the nobility, about the authority of the sovereign courts, about the right of corporations, about provincial privileges, which, while softening the blows of authority, maintained a spirit of resistance in the nation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2955">These political institutions, though often contrary to the liberty of individuals, nonetheless served to foster the love of liberty in souls, and in this respect their utility is easily conceived. Apart from these institutions, opinions and mores raised less known, but no less powerful barriers around royal power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2956">Religion, love of subjects, the goodness of the prince, honor, family spirit, provincial prejudices, custom and public opinion limited the power of kings and enclosed their authority within an invisible circle.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>507<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2957">Then the constitution of peoples was despotic and their mores, free. Princes had the right, but neither the faculty nor the desire to do everything.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2958">Of the barriers that formerly stopped tyranny, what remains to us today?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2959">Since religion has lost its dominion over souls, the most visible limit that divided good and bad is overturned; all seems doubtful and uncertain in the moral realm; kings and people move there haphazardly, and no one can say where the natural limits of despotism and the bounds of license are.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2960">Long revolutions have forever destroyed the respect that surrounded heads of State. Released from the weight of public esteem, princes can henceforth abandon themselves without fear to being drunk with power.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1173" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1173_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2961">When kings see, coming before them, the heart of peoples, they are lenient because they feel strong; and they treat the love of their subjects carefully, because the love of subjects is the support of the throne. Then, between the prince and the people, an exchange of sentiments is established whose gentleness recalls within society the interior of the family. Subjects, while murmuring against the sovereign, are still distressed to displease him, and the sovereign strikes his subjects with a light hand, as a father chastises his children.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2962">But once the prestige of royalty has vanished amid the tumult of revolutions; when kings, following each other upon the throne, have one by one exposed to the view of the people the weakness of <span class="ital">right</span> and the harshness <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>508<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of <span class="ital">fact,</span><a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1174" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1174_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a> no one any longer sees in the sovereign the father of the State, and each one sees a master there. If he is weak, he is scorned; he is hated if he is strong. He is himself full of rage and fear; he sees himself as a stranger in his country and treats his subjects as the vanquished.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2963">When provinces and cities were so many different nations in the middle of the common native land, each one of them had a particular spirit that opposed the general spirit of servitude; but today when, after losing their franchises, their customs, their prejudices and even their memories and their names, all parts of the same empire have become accustomed to obeying the same laws, it is no more difficult to oppress all of them together than to oppress one separately from the rest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2964">While the nobility enjoyed its power, and still long after it had lost it, aristocratic honor gave an extraordinary strength to individual resistance.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2970">What strength remains to customs among a people who have changed entirely and who change constantly, where all the acts of tyranny already have a precedent, where all crimes can rest on an example, where you can find nothing so old that you are afraid to destroy it, nor anything so new that you cannot dare to do it?</p>

Then nothing protected citizens any longer, and citizens no longer protected <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>511<span class="bracket">]</span></span> themselves; you saw men mock human nature and princes exhaust the mercy of heaven rather than the patience of their subjects.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1180" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1180_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2975">Those who think to rediscover the monarchy of Henry IV or Louis XIV seem very blind to me. As for me, when I consider the state which several European nations have already reached and toward which all the others are tending, I feel myself led to believe that among them there will soon no longer be a place except for democratic liberty<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1181" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1181_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> or for the tyranny of the Caesars.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1182" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1182_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2976">Doesn’t this merit reflection? If men must in fact reach the point where they must all be made free or all slaves, all equal in rights or all deprived of rights; if those who govern societies were reduced to the alternative of gradually raising the crowd up to their level or allowing all citizens to fall below <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>512<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the level of humanity, wouldn’t this be enough to overcome many doubts, reassure many consciences, and prepare each person to make great sacrifices easily?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2977">Shouldn’t the gradual development of democratic institutions and mores then be considered, not as the best, but as the sole means that remains for us to be free; and without loving the government of democracy, wouldn’t we be disposed to adopt it as the most applicable and most decent remedy that may be opposed to the present ills of society?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1183" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1183_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2979">The will of democracy is changeable; its agents, crude; its laws, imperfect; I grant it. But if it were true that soon no intermediary must exist between the dominion of democracy and the yoke of one man, shouldn’t we tend toward the one rather than subject ourselves voluntarily to the other? And if it were necessary finally to arrive at a complete equality, wouldn’t it be better to allow ourselves to be leveled by liberty than by a despot?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2980">Those who, after reading this book, would judge that by writing it I wanted to propose the Anglo-American laws and mores for the imitation of all peoples who have a democratic social state would have made a great error; they would be attached to the form, abandoning the very substance of my thought.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1185" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1185_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> My goal has been to show, by the example of America, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>513<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that laws and above all mores could allow a democratic people to remain free.

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2982">The principal task that I had set for myself has now been fulfilled; I have succeeded, at least as much as I could, in showing what the laws of the American democracy were; I have made its mores known. I could stop here, but the reader would perhaps find that I have not satisfied his expectation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2983">You encounter in America something more than an immense and complete democracy; the peoples who inhabit the New World can be seen from more than one point of view.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2984">In the course of this work, my subject often led me to speak about Indians <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>516<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and Negroes, but I never had the time to stop to show what position these two races occupy in the midst of the democratic people that I was busy portraying; I said according to what spirit, with the aid of what laws, the Anglo-American confederation had been formed; I could only indicate in passing, and in a very incomplete way, the dangers that menace this confederation, and it was impossible for me to explain in detail what its chances of enduring were, apart from laws and mores. While speaking about the united republics, I hazarded no conjecture about the permanence of republican forms in the New World, and although alluding frequently to the commercial activity that reigns in the Union, I was not able to deal with the future of the Americans as a commercial people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2985">These topics touch on my subject, but do not enter into it; they are American without being democratic, and above all I wanted to portray democracy. So I had to put them aside at first; but I must return to them as I finish.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1190" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1190_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2986">The territory occupied today, or claimed by the American Union, extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the shores of the Pacific Ocean. So in the east or in the west, its limits are those of the continent itself; the territory advances in the south to the edge of the Tropics and then goes back up to the middle of the frozen areas of the North.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2987">The men spread throughout this space do not form, as in Europe, so many offshoots of the same family. You discover among them, from the outset, three naturally distinct and, I could almost say, enemy races. Education, laws, origins and even the external form of their features, have raised an almost insurmountable barrier between them; fortune gathered them together on the same soil, but it mixed them together without being able to blend them, and each one pursues its destiny apart.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2988">Among such diverse men, the first who attracts attention, the first in enlightenment, in power, in happiness, is the white man, the European, man <span class="ital">par excellence;</span><a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1191" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1191_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> below him appear the Negro and the Indian.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>517<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2989">These two unfortunate races have neither birth, nor facial features, nor language, nor mores in common; their misfortunes alone are similar. Both occupy an equally inferior position in the country that they inhabit; both suffer the effects of tyranny; and if their miseries are different, they can blame the same authors for them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2990">Wouldn’t you say, seeing what is happening in the world, that the European is to the men of other races what man himself is to the animals? He makes them serve his purposes, and when he cannot make them bend, he destroys them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1192" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1192_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2991">Oppression deprived the descendants of the Africans at a stroke of nearly all the privileges of humanity. The Negro of the United States has lost even the memory of his country; he no longer hears the language spoken by his fathers; he has renounced their religion and forgotten their mores. While thus ceasing to belong to Africa, however, he has acquired no right to the good things of Europe; but he has stopped between the two societies; he has remained isolated between the two peoples; sold by the one and repudiated by the other; finding in the whole world only the home of his master to offer him the incomplete picture of a native land.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2992">The Negro has no family; he cannot see in a woman anything other than the temporary companion of his pleasures and, at birth, his sons are his equals.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2993">Shall I call it a benefit of God or a final curse of His anger, this disposition of the soul that makes man insensible to extreme miseries and often even gives him a kind of depraved taste for the cause of his misfortunes?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2994">Plunged into this abyss of evils, the Negro scarcely feels his misfortune; violence had placed him in slavery; the practice of servitude has given him the thoughts and ambition of a slave; he admires his tyrants even more than he hates them, and finds his joy and his pride in servile imitation of those who oppress him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2995">His intelligence has fallen to the level of his soul.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2996">The Negro enters into servitude and into life at the same time. What <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>518<span class="bracket">]</span></span> am I saying? Often he is purchased right from the womb of his mother, and so to speak he starts to be a slave before being born.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2997">Without need as without pleasure, useless to himself, he understands, by the first notions that he receives of existence, that he is the property of another, whose interest is to watch over his days; he sees that the care for his own fate has not devolved upon him. The very use of thought seems to him a useless gift from Providence, and he peacefully enjoys all the privileges of his servility.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2998">If he becomes free, independence often then seems to him to be a heavier chain than slavery itself; for in the course of his existence, he has learned to submit to everything, except to reason; and when reason becomes his sole guide, he cannot recognize its voice. A thousand new needs besiege him, and he lacks the knowledge and the energy necessary to resist them. Needs are masters that must be fought, and he has only learned to submit and to obey. So he has reached this depth of misery in which servitude brutalizes him and liberty destroys him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_2999">Oppression has exercised no less influence over the Indian races, but its effects are different.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3000">[≠Europeans have introduced some new needs and some unknown vices among the savages of North America; but they have not been able entirely to modify the character of these savage bands. Europeans have been able to make their tribes disappear, to invade [v: to take the land away from them] their native land, but they have never submitted to the Europeans. Some have evaded servitude by flight, others by death.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3001">Before the arrival of whites in the New World, the men who inhabited North America lived tranquilly in the woods. Given over to the ordinary vicissitudes of savage life, they exhibited the vices and virtues of uncivilized peoples.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1193" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1193_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> Europeans, after scattering the Indian tribes far into the wilderness, condemned them to a wandering and restless life, full of inexpressible miseries.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>519<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3002">Savage nations are governed only by opinions and mores.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3003">By weakening the sentiment of native land among the Indians of North America, by scattering their families, by obscuring their traditions, by interrupting the chain of memory, by changing all their habits, and by increasing their needs inordinately, European tyranny has made them more disorderly and less civilized than they already were. The moral condition and physical state of these peoples did not cease to deteriorate at the same time, and they became more barbaric as they became more unhappy. Nonetheless, Europeans have not been able entirely to modify the character of the Indians, and with the power to destroy them, they have never had that of civilizing and subjugating them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3004">The Negro is placed at the furthest limits of servitude; the Indian, at the extreme limits of liberty. The effects of slavery on the first are scarcely more harmful than the effects of independence on the second.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3005">The Negro has lost even ownership of his person, and he cannot dispose of his own existence without committing a kind of larceny.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3006">The savage is left to himself as soon as he can act. He has hardly known the authority of family; he has never bent his will to that of his fellows; no one has taught him to distinguish a voluntary obedience from a shameful subjection, and he is unaware of even the name of law. For him, to be free is to escape nearly all the bonds of society. He delights in this barbarous independence, and he would prefer to perish rather than to sacrifice the smallest part of it. Civilization has little hold over such a man.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3007">The Negro makes a thousand hapless efforts in order to enter into a society that pushes him away; he bows to the tastes of his oppressors, adopts their opinions, and aspires, by imitating them, to be mingled with them. He has been told since birth that his race is naturally inferior to that of the whites and he is not far from believing it; so he is ashamed of himself. In each one of his features he finds a mark of slavery and, if he could, he would joyfully consent to repudiate himself completely.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3008">The Indian, in contrast, has an imagination entirely filled with the alleged nobility of his origin. He lives and dies amid these dreams of his pride.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1194" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1194_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a> Far <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>520<span class="bracket">]</span></span> from wanting to bend his mores to ours, he is attached to barbarism as a distinctive sign of his race, and he rejects civilization perhaps still less out of hatred for it than out of fear of resembling the Europeans.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1195" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1195_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">1</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3009">To the perfection of our arts, he wants to oppose only the resources of the wilderness; to our tactics, only his undisciplined courage; to the depth of our plans, only the spontaneous instincts of his savage nature. He succumbs in this unequal struggle.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1197" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1197_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3010">The Negro would like to mingle with the European, and he cannot do so. The Indian could, to a certain point, succeed in doing so, but he disdains to try. The servility of the one delivers him to slavery, and the pride of the other, to death.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3011">I remember that traveling through the forests that still cover the state of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>521<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Alabama, I arrived one day next to the cabin of a pioneer. I did not want to enter the dwelling of the American, but I went to rest for a few moments at the edge of a spring not far from there in the woods. While I was in this place, an Indian woman came (we then were near the territory occupied by the Creek nation); she held the hand of a small girl five or six years old, belonging to the white race, whom I supposed to be the daughter of the pioneer. A Negro woman followed them. A kind of barbaric luxury distinguished the costume of the Indian woman: metal rings were suspended from her nostrils and ears; her hair, mixed with glass beads, fell freely over her shoulders, and I saw that she wasn’t married, for she still wore the shell necklace that virgins customarily put down on the nuptial bed. The Negro woman was dressed in European clothes almost in tatters.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3012">All three came to sit down beside the spring, and the young savage, taking the child in her arms, lavished on her caresses that you could have believed were dictated by a mother’s heart; on her side, the Negro woman sought by a thousand innocent tricks to attract the attention of the small Creole. The latter showed in her slightest movements a sentiment of superiority that contrasted strangely with her weakness and her age; you would have said that she received the attentions of her companions with a kind of condescension.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3013">Squatting in front of her mistress, watching closely for each of her desires, the Negro woman seemed equally divided between an almost maternal attachment and a servile fear; while a free, proud, and almost fierce air distinguished even the savage woman’s effusion of tenderness.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3014">I approached and contemplated this spectacle in silence; my curiosity undoubtedly displeased the Indian woman, for she suddenly arose, pushed the child far away from her with a kind of roughness, and, after giving me an irritated look, plunged into the woods.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3015">I had often happened to see gathered in the same places individuals belonging to the three human races that people North America. I had already recognized by a thousand various effects the preponderance exercised by the whites. But, in the scene that I have just described, there was something particularly touching: a bond of affection united the oppressed to the oppressors here, and nature, by trying hard to bring them together, made still more striking the immense space put between them by prejudice and laws.</p>

All the nations that I have just named formerly extended as far as the shores of the sea; now you must go more than one hundred leagues into the interior of the continent to meet an Indian.

Neither a development so prodigious nor a destruction so rapid has ever been seen among nations.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3018">It is easy to indicate the manner in which this destruction is taking place.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3019">When the Indians lived alone in the wilderness from which they are exiled today, their needs were few [and the means to provide for them very numerous]; they made their own arms; river water was their only drink; and they had as clothing the hide of the animals whose flesh served to nourish them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3020">Europeans introduced to the natives of North America firearms, iron and brandy; they taught them to replace with our fabrics the barbarian clothing that contented Indian simplicity until then. While contracting new tastes, the Indians have not learned the art of satisfying them, and they have had to resort to the industry of whites. In return for these goods, which he himself did not know how to create, the savage could offer nothing, other than the rich furs that his woods still contained. From this moment, the hunt had to provide not only for his needs, but also for the frivolous passions of Europe. He no longer pursued the beasts of the forest only to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>524<span class="bracket">]</span></span> nourish himself, but to obtain the only objects of exchange that he could give us.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1201" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1201_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">3</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3021">While the needs of the natives grew in this way, their resources did not cease to diminish.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3022">From the day when a European settlement forms in the neighborhood of the territory occupied by the Indians, the wild game becomes alarmed.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1203" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1203_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> Thousands of savages, wandering in the forests, without fixed abodes, do not frighten the game; but the instant the continuous noises of European industry are heard in some place, the game begins to flee and to withdraw toward the west, where its instinct teaches it that still limitless wildernesses will be found. “But the buffalo is constantly receding,” say Messrs. Cass and Clark in their report to Congress, 4 February 1829. “A few years since, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>525<span class="bracket">]</span></span> they approached the base of the Alleghany, and a few years hence they may even be rare upon the immense plains which extend to the base of the Rocky Mountains.” I was assured that this effect of the approach of whites [{Europeans}] often makes itself felt two hundred leagues from their frontier. Their influence is exercised therefore on tribes whose name they hardly know and who suffer the evils of usurpation long before knowing the authors of it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1204" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1204_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">5</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3023">Soon hardy adventurers penetrate the Indian countries; they advance fifteen or twenty leagues beyond the extreme frontier of the whites and go to build the dwelling of civilized man in the very midst of barbarism. It is easy for them to do so: the limits of the territory of a hunting people are poorly fixed. This territory belongs, moreover, to the entire nation and is not precisely the property of anyone; so individual interest defends no part of it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1205" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1205_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3024">A few European families, occupying widely separated points, then succeed in chasing forever the wild animals from all the intermediate space that stretches between them. The Indians, who had lived until then in a sort of abundance, find it difficult to survive, still more difficult to obtain the objects of exchange that they need. By making their game flee, it is as if you made the fields of our farmers sterile. Soon they almost entirely lack the means of existence. You then meet these unfortunate people prowling about like famished wolves amid their deserted woods. Instinctive love of native land attaches them to the soil where they were born,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1206" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1206_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> and they no <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>526<span class="bracket">]</span></span> longer find anything there except misery and death. They finally make up their minds; they leave, and following at a distance the flight of the elk, the buffalo and the beaver, they leave to these wild animals the care of choosing a new homeland for them. So it is not, strictly speaking, the Europeans<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1207" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1207_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a> who chase the natives of America away, it is famine; happy distinction that had escaped the old casuists and that modern [{Protestant}] doctors have discovered.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3025">You cannot imagine the dreadful evils that accompany these forced emigrations. At the moment when the Indians left their paternal lands, they were already exhausted and reduced. The country where they are going to settle is occupied by wandering tribes who see the new arrivals only with jealousy. Behind them is hunger, ahead of them is war, everywhere there is misery. In order to escape so many enemies, they divide up. Each one of them tries to isolate himself in order to find furtively the means to sustain his existence, and lives in the immensity of the wilderness like the outlaw in the bosom of civilized societies. The social bond, long weakened, then breaks. For them, there already was no longer a native land. Soon there will no longer be a people; families will scarcely remain; the common name is being lost, language forgotten, the traces of origin disappear. The nation has ceased to exist. It scarcely lives in the memory of American antiquarians and is known only to a few European scholars.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3026">I would not want the reader to be able to believe that I am exaggerating my descriptions here.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1208" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1208_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a> I have seen with my own eyes several of the miseries that I have just described; I have gazed upon evils that would be impossible for me to recount.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3027">At the end of the year 1831, I found myself on the left bank of the Mississippi, at a place named Memphis by the Europeans. While I was in this place, a numerous troop of Choctaws (the French of Louisiana call them <span class="ital">Chactas</span>) came; these savages left their country and tried to pass to the right bank of the Mississippi where they flattered themselves about finding a refuge that the American government had promised them. It was then the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>527<span class="bracket">]</span></span> heart of winter, and the cold gripped that year with unaccustomed intensity; snow had hardened on the ground, and the river swept along enormous chunks of ice. The Indians led their families with them; they dragged along behind them the wounded, the sick, the newborn children, the elderly about to die. They had neither tents nor wagons, but only a few provisions and weapons. I saw them embark to cross the great river, and this solemn spectacle will never leave my memory. You heard among this assembled crowd neither sobs nor complaints; they kept quiet. Their misfortunes were old and seemed to them without remedy. All the Indians had already entered the vessel that was to carry them; their dogs still remained on the bank; when these animals saw finally that their masters were going away forever, they let out dreadful howls, and throwing themselves at the same time into the icy waters of the Mississippi, they swam after their masters.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3028">The dispossession of the Indians often takes place today in a regular and, so to speak, entirely legal manner.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3029">When the European population begins to approach the wilderness occupied by a savage nation, the government of the United States commonly sends to the latter a solemn embassy. The whites assemble the Indians in a great field and, after eating and drinking with them, say to them:</p>
<div class="cit">
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3030">What are you doing in the land of your fathers? Soon you will have to dig up their bones to live there. How is the country where you live better than another? Are there woods, marshes and prairies only here where you are, and can you live only under your sun? Beyond these mountains that you see on the horizon, beyond the lake that borders your territory on the west, you find vast countries where wild game is still found in abundance; sell us your lands and go to live happily in those places.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3031">After giving this speech, firearms, woolen clothing, casks of brandy, glass necklaces, tin bracelets, earrings and mirrors are spread out before the eyes of the Indians.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1209" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1209_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">7</a> If, at the sight of all these riches, they still hesitate, it is <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>528<span class="bracket">]</span></span> insinuated that they cannot refuse the consent demanded of them, and that soon the government itself will be unable to guarantee to them the enjoyment of their rights.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1210" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1210_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> What to do? Half persuaded, half forced, the Indians move away; they go to inhabit new wildernesses where whites will not leave them in peace for even ten years. In this way the Americans acquire at a very low price entire provinces that the richest sovereigns of Europe could not afford.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1211" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1211_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">8</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3032">I have just recounted great evils, I add that they seem irremediable to me. I believe that the Indian race of North America is condemned to perish, and I cannot prevent myself from thinking that the day the Europeans settle on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, that race will have ceased to exist.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1212" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1212_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">9</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3033">The Indians of North America had only two paths to salvation: war or civilization; in other words, they had to destroy the Europeans or become their equal.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3034">At the birth of the colonies, it would have been possible for them, by uniting their forces, to rid themselves of the small number of foreigners who had just arrived at the shores of the continent.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1213" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1213_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">10</a> More than once, they attempted to do it and saw themselves on the verge of success. Today the disproportion of resources is too great for them to be able to consider such an undertaking.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1214" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1214_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a> But men of genius still arise among the Indian nations, who foresee the final fate reserved for the savage populations and who seek to bring together all the tribes in a common hatred of Europeans [{and to silence individual animosities in order to deal only with this objective [v: <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>530<span class="bracket">]</span></span> to consider all saving themselves}];<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1215" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1215_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> but their efforts are ineffectual. The tribes that are near the whites are already too weak to offer effective resistance; the others, abandoning themselves to this childish lack of concern about tomorrow that characterizes savage nature, wait for the danger to appear before giving it their attention. The first cannot act, the others do not want to act.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3035">[≠If at the same time that the Indians gave up hope of chasing the Europeans away from American soil, they had succeeded in becoming civilized, they would still be able to avoid the destruction that threatens them, for it is nearly impossible to dispossess a farming people completely.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3036">It is easy to foresee that the Indians will never want to become civilized, or that they will try too late, when they reach the point of wanting to do so.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3037">Civilization is the result of a long work of society that proceeds in the same place and that the different successive generations bequeath to one another. It is among hunting peoples that civilization has the greatest difficulty managing to establish its dominion. Tribes of herders change places, but they always follow a regular order in their migrations and constantly retrace their steps; the dwelling-place of hunters varies like that of the very animals they pursue.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3038">Several times the attempt has been made to bring enlightenment to the Indians while leaving them with the mores of wandering peoples; the Jesuits had tried to do it in Canada, the Puritans in New England.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1217" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1217_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">11</a> Both accomplished nothing lasting. Civilization was born within the hut and went to die in the woods. The great failing of these legislators of the Indians was not to understand that, to succeed in civilizing a people, it is necessary <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>531<span class="bracket">]</span></span> above all to get them to settle down, and they can only do so by cultivating the soil; so it was first a matter of making the Indians farmers.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3039">Not only do the Indians not possess this indispensable preliminary of civilization, but also it is very difficult for them to acquire.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3040">Men who have once given themselves over to the idle and adventurous life of hunters feel an almost insurmountable distaste for the constant and regular work required by farming. You can see it even within our societies; but it is even much more visible among peoples for whom hunting habits have become the national customs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3041">Apart from this general cause, a cause no less powerful is found only among the Indians. I have already pointed it out; I believe I must return to it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3042">The natives of North America consider work not only as an evil, but also as a dishonor, and their pride struggles against civilization almost as obstinately as their idleness.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1218" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1218_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">12</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3043">There is no Indian so miserable who, in his bark hut, does not maintain a proud idea of his individual value; he considers the cares of industry as degrading occupations; he compares the farmer to the ox that traces the furrow, and in each of our arts he sees only the work of slaves. It is not that he has not conceived a very high idea of the power of whites and of the grandeur of their intelligence; but, if he admires the result of our efforts, he scorns the means that we have used to obtain them, and, even while under our influence, he still believes himself superior to us. Hunting and war seem to him the only cares worthy of a man.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1219" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1219_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">13</a> So the Indian, deep <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>532<span class="bracket">]</span></span> within the misery of his woods, nurtures the same ideas, the same opinions as the noble<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1220" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1220_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> of the Middle Ages in his fortress, and to resemble him fully he only needs to become a conqueror. How strange! It is in the forests of the New World, and not among the Europeans who populate its shores, that the ancient prejudices of Europe are found today.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3044">I have tried more than once, in the course of this work, to make understood the prodigious influence that the social state seemed to me to exercise on the laws and mores of men. Allow me to add a single word to the subject.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3045">When I notice the similarity that exists between the political institutions of our fathers, the Teutons, and those of the wandering tribes of North America, between the customs recounted by Tacitus and those that I was sometimes able to witness, I cannot prevent myself from thinking that the same cause has produced, in the two hemispheres, the same results, and that amid the apparent diversity of human affairs, it is not impossible to find a small number of generative facts from which all the others derive. So in all that we call Teutonic institutions, I am tempted to see only the habits of barbarians, and the opinions of savages in what we call feudal ideas.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1221" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1221_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>533<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3046">Whatever the vices and prejudices that prevent the Indians of North America from becoming farmers and civilized, necessity sometimes forces them to do so.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3047">Several considerable nations of the South, among others those of the Cherokees and the Creeks,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1222" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1222_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">14</a> found themselves as though encircled by Europeans who, landing on the shores of the Ocean, going down the Ohio and coming back up the Mississippi, surrounded them all at once. They were not chased from place to place, as the tribes of the North were, but were squeezed little by little into limits that were too narrow, as hunters first make an enclosure around a thicket before entering simultaneously into the interior. The Indians, placed then between civilization and death, saw themselves reduced to living shamefully by their work like whites; so they became farmers, and without entirely abandoning either their habits or their mores, they sacrificed what was absolutely necessary for their existence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3048">The Cherokees went further; they created a written language, established a fairly stable form of government; and, as everything moves with a hurried step in the New World, they had a newspaper<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1223" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1223_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">15</a> before all had clothes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3049">What singularly favored the rapid development of European habits among these Indians was the presence of half-breeds.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1224" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1224_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">16</a> Sharing the enlightenment of his father without necessarily abandoning the savage customs <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>534<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of his maternal race, the half-breed forms the natural link between civilization and barbarism. Wherever half-breeds have multiplied, savages are seen to modify little by little their social state and change their mores.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1225" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1225_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">17</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3050">So the success of the Cherokees proves that the Indians have the ability to become civilized, but it in no way proves that they can succeed in doing so.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1226" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1226_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3051">This difficulty that the Indians find in submitting to civilization arises from a general cause that is nearly impossible for them to elude.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>535<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3052">If you cast an attentive eye on history, you discover that in general barbaric peoples have risen little by little by themselves, and by their own efforts, toward civilization.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3053">When it happened that they went to draw enlightenment from a foreign nation, they did so with the rank of conquerors, and not the position of the vanquished.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3054">When the conquered people are enlightened and the conquering people half-savage, as in the invasion of the Roman Empire by the nations of the North, or in that of China by the Mongols, the power that victory assures to the barbarian is enough to keep him at the level of the civilized man and allow him to move as his equal, until he becomes his equal; the one has strength in his favor, the other, intelligence; the first admires the arts and sciences of the vanquished, the second envies the power of the conquerors. The barbarians end by introducing the civilized man into their palaces, and the civilized man in turn opens his schools to them. But when the one who possesses physical force enjoys intellectual preponderance at the same time, it is rare for the vanquished to become civilized; he withdraws or is destroyed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3055">Therefore you can say in a general way that savages are going to seek enlightenment with weapons in hand, but that they do not receive it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1227" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1227_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3056">If the Indian tribes who now inhabit the center of the continent could find in themselves enough energy to undertake becoming civilized, they would perhaps succeed. Superior then to the barbarian nations that surround them, they would little by little gain strength and experience, and, when the Europeans finally appeared on their frontiers, they would be in a state, if not to maintain their independence, at least to make their rights to the soil recognized and to become integrated with the conquerors. But the misfortune of the Indians is to enter into contact with the most civilized, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>536<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and I will add the most greedy people of the globe, while they are themselves still half barbarian; to find in their teachers, masters, and to receive oppression and enlightenment at the same time.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1228" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1228_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3057">Living within the liberty of the woods, the Indian of North America was miserable, but he felt inferior to no one; from the moment he wants to enter into the social hierarchy of the whites, he can occupy only the last rank; for he enters ignorant and poor into a society where knowledge and wealth reign. After leading an agitated life, full of evils and dangers, but filled at the same time with emotions and grandeur,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1229" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1229_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">18</a> he must submit to a <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>537<span class="bracket">]</span></span> <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>538<span class="bracket">]</span></span> monotonous, obscure and degraded existence. To earn by hard work and amid shame the bread that must nourish him, such in his eyes is the sole result of this civilization that is praised to him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3058">And he is not always sure to obtain even this result.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3059">When the Indians undertake to imitate the Europeans their neighbors, and like them to cultivate the land, they soon find themselves exposed to the effects of a very destructive competition. The white is master of the secrets of agriculture. The Indian starts out crudely in an art that he does not know. The one easily makes great harvests grow, the other extracts the fruits of the earth only with a thousand efforts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3060">The European is placed amid a population that he knows and whose needs he shares.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3061">The savage is isolated in the middle of an enemy people whose mores, language and laws he knows incompletely, but without whom he cannot manage. Only by exchanging his products for those of the whites can he become well-off, for his compatriots are nothing more than a feeble help to him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3062">Therefore, when the Indian wants to sell the fruits of his work, he does not always find the buyer that the European farmer easily finds, and he can produce only at great cost what the other delivers for a small price.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3063">So the Indian has escaped from the evils to which barbarian nations are exposed only to subject himself to the greatest miseries of civilized peoples, and he finds almost as much difficulty living amid our abundance as within his forests.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>539<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3064">At home, however, the habits of the wandering life are still not destroyed. Traditions have not lost their dominion; the taste for hunting has not been extinguished. The savage joys that he formerly experienced deep within the woods are then represented by the most vivid colors in his troubled imagination; the privations that he endured there seem to him less dreadful in contrast, the perils that he encountered less great. The independence that he enjoyed among his equals contrasts with the servile position that he occupies in civilized society.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3065">From another perspective, the solitude where, for so long, he lived free is still near him; a few hours of walking can restore it to him. For the half-cleared field from which he draws hardly enough to feed himself, the whites, his neighbors, offer him a price that to him seems high. Perhaps this money that the Europeans present to him would allow him to live happily and tranquilly far from them. He leaves his plow, picks up his weapons, and goes into the wilderness again forever.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1231" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1231_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">19</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>540<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3066">You can judge the truth of this sad portrait by what is happening among the Creeks and the Cherokees, whom I cited.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3067">These Indians, in the little that they have done, have surely shown as much natural genius as the peoples of Europe in their wider undertakings; but nations, like men, need time to learn, whatever their intelligence and their efforts.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1232" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1232_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3068">While these savages worked to become civilized, the Europeans continued to envelop them from all sides and to squeeze them in more and more. Today, the two races have finally met; they touch each other. The Indian has already become superior to his father, the savage, but he is still very inferior to the white, his neighbor. With the aid of their resources and their enlightenment, the Europeans did not take long to appropriate most of the advantages that possession of the soil could provide to the natives; the Europeans settled among them, seized the land or bought it at a low price, and ruined the Indians by a competition that the latter could in no way sustain. Isolated in their own country, the Indians no longer formed anything except a small colony of inconvenient foreigners in the middle of a numerous and dominating people.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1233" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1233_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">20</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3069">Washington said, in one of his messages to Congress: “We are more enlightened and more powerful than the Indian nations; it is to our honor to treat them with kindness and even with generosity.”</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3070">This noble and virtuous policy has not been followed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3071">The greediness of the colonists usually joins with the tyranny of the government. Although the Cherokees and the Creeks were settled on the soil they inhabited before the arrival of the Europeans, although the Americans often negotiated with them as with foreign nations, the states within which they find themselves did not want to recognize them as independent peoples, and undertook to subject these men, barely out of the forests, to their magistrates, to their customs and to their laws.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1234" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1234_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">21</a> Misery had pushed these unfortunate Indians toward civilization, oppression drives them today back toward barbarism. Many of them, leaving their half-cleared fields, resume the habit of savage life.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3072">If you pay attention to the tyrannical measures adopted by the legislatures of the states of the South, to the conduct of their governors and the actions of their courts, you will easily be convinced that the complete expulsion of the Indians is the final goal toward which all their efforts simultaneously tend. The Americans of this part of the Union enviously regard the lands that the natives possess;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1235" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1235_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">22</a> they feel that the latter have not yet completely lost the traditions of savage life, and before civilization has firmly attached them to the soil, they want to reduce them to despair and force them to move away.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3073">Oppressed by the particular states, the Creeks and Cherokees addressed <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>542<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the central government. The latter is not insensitive to their misfortunes; that government would sincerely like to save the remnants of the natives and assure them the free possession of the territory that it guaranteed to them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1236" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1236_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">23</a> But when it seeks to execute this plan, the particular states put up a formidable resistance, and then the central government resolves without difficulty to let a few savage tribes, already half destroyed, perish in order not to put the American Union in danger.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1237" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1237_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3074">Powerless to protect the Indians, the federal government would at least like to ease their lot; to this end, it has undertaken to transport them at its expense to other places.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1238" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1238_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3075">Between the latitudes of 33rd and 37th degrees north, extends a vast country that has taken the name Arkansas, from the principal river that waters it. It borders on one side the frontier of Mexico, on the other, the banks of the Mississippi. A multitude of small streams and rivers cut across it from all sides; the climate is mild and the soil fertile. Only a few wandering hordes of savages are found there.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1239" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1239_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> It is to a section of this country, which is closest to Mexico and at a great distance from American settlements, that the government of the Union wants to transport the remnants of the native populations of the South.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3076">At the end of the year 1831, we were assured that 10,000 Indians had already gone to the banks of the Arkansas; others arrived every day. But Congress has not been able to create as well a unanimous will among those whose fate it wanted to determine. Some consent with joy to move away from the home of tyranny; the most enlightened refuse to abandon their growing crops and new dwellings; they think that if the work of civilization is interrupted, it will not be resumed again; they fear that sedentary habits, barely contracted, will be permanently lost in the middle of still savage countries where nothing is prepared for the subsistence of a farming people; they know that in this new wilderness they will find enemy hordes and, to resist them, they no longer have the energy of barbarism and have not yet acquired the strength of civilization. The Indians easily discover, moreover, all that is provisional in the settlement that is proposed to them. Who will assure them that they will finally be able to rest in peace in their new refuge? The United States promises to maintain them there; but the territory that they now occupy had formerly been guaranteed to them by the most solemn oaths.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1240" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1240_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">24</a> Today the American government does not, it is true, take their <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>544<span class="bracket">]</span></span> lands from them, but it allows their lands to be invaded. In a few years, undoubtedly, the same white population that now presses around them will again be at their heels in the solitude of Arkansas; they will then find the same evils again without the same remedies; and sooner or later without land, they will still have to resign themselves to dying.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3077">There is less cupidity and violence in the way the Union acts toward the Indians than in the policy followed by the states; but the two governments equally lack good faith.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3078">The states, while extending what they call the benefit of their laws to the Indians,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1241" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1241_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a> count on the fact that the latter will prefer to move away than to submit; and the central government, while promising these unfortunate people a permanent refuge in the West, is not unaware that it is not able to guarantee it to them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1242" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1242_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">25</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3079">Therefore, the states, by their tyranny, force the savages to flee; the Union, by its promises and with the aid of its resources, makes the flight easy. These are different measures that aim at the same end.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1243" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1243_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">26</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3080">“By the will of our Father in Heaven, the Governor of the whole world,” said the Cherokees in their petition to Congress,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1244" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1244_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">27</a> “the red man of America has become small, and the white man great and renowned.”</p>
<div class="cit">
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3081">When the ancestors of the people of these United States first came to the shores of America, they found the red man strong—though he was ignorant and savage, yet he received them kindly, and gave them dry land to rest their weary feet. They met in peace, and shook hands in token of friendship.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3082">Whatever the white man wanted and asked of the Indian, the latter willingly gave. At that time the Indian was the lord, and the white man the suppliant. But now the scene has changed. The strength of the red man has become weakness. As his neighbors increased in numbers, his power became less and less, and now, of the many and powerful tribes who once covered these United States, only a few are to be seen—a few whom a sweeping pestilence has left. The Northern tribes, who were once so numerous and powerful, are now nearly extinct. Thus it has happened to the red man of America.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3083">Shall we, who are remnants, share the same fate? [… (ed.) …]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3084">The land on which we stand we have received as an inheritance from our fathers, who possessed it from time immemorial, as a gift from our common Father in Heaven. [… (ed.) …] They bequeathed it to us as their children, and we have sacredly kept it, as containing the remains of our beloved men. This right of inheritance we have never ceded nor ever forfeited. Permit us to ask what better right can the people have to a country than the right of inheritance and immemorial peaceable possession? We know it is said of late by the State of Georgia, and by the Executive of the United States, that we have forfeited this right—but we think this is said gratuitously. At what time have we made the forfeit? What great crime have we committed, whereby we must forever be divested of our country?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1245" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1245_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a> Was it when we were hostile to the United States, and took part with the King of Great Britain, during the struggle for independence?

Why was not such an article as the following inserted in the treaty: “The United States give peace to the Cherokees, but, for the part they took in the late war, declare them to be but tenants at will, to be removed when the convenience of the States, within whose chartered limits they live, shall require it”? That was the proper time to assume such a possession. But it was not thought of, nor would our forefathers have agreed to any treaty whose tendency was to deprive them of their rights and their country.</p>
</div>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3085">Such is the language of the Indians; what they say is true; what they foresee seems inevitable to me.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3086">From whatever side you envisage the destiny of the natives of North America, you see only irremediable evils. If they remain savage, they are pushed ahead and kept on the move; if they want to become civilized, contact with men more civilized than they delivers them to oppression and misery. If they continue to wander from wilderness to wilderness, they perish; if they undertake to settle down, they still perish. They can become enlightened only with the aid of Europeans, and the approach of Europeans depraves them and pushes them back toward barbarism. As long as you leave them in their empty wilderness, they refuse to change their mores, and when they are finally forced to want to change them, there is no more time to do so.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3087">The Spanish unleash their dogs on the Indians as on wild beasts; they pillage the New World like a city taken by assault, without discrimination and without pity; but you cannot destroy everything, fury has an end. The rest of the Indian populations that escaped the massacres ended up mingling with their conquerors and adopting their religion and their mores [{the Indians today share the rights of those who conquered them and one day perhaps will rule over them}].<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1246" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1246_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">28</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3088">The conduct of the Americans of the United States toward the natives radiates, in contrast, the purest love of forms and of legality. Provided that the Indians remain in the savage state, the Americans do not in any way <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>547<span class="bracket">]</span></span> get involved in their affairs and they treat them as independent peoples; they do not allow themselves to occupy their lands without having duly acquired them by means of a contract; and if by chance an Indian nation is no longer able to live in its territory, the Americans take it fraternally by the hand and lead it themselves to die outside of the country of its fathers.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3089">The Spanish, with the help of monstrous crimes without precedents, while covering themselves with an indelible shame [{that will live as long as their name}], were not able to succeed in exterminating the Indian race, nor even in preventing it from sharing their rights;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1247" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1247_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a> the Americans of the United States have achieved this double result with a marvelous ease, calmly, legally, philanthropically, without shedding blood, without violating a single one of the great principles of morality<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1248" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1248_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">29</a> in the eyes of the world.

<p class="indent-no" id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3092">The Indians will die in isolation as they lived; but the destiny of the Negroes is in a way intertwined with that of the Europeans. Although the two races are bound to each other, they do not blend together. It is as difficult for them to separate completely as to unite.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3093">The most formidable of all the evils that threaten the future of the United States arises from the presence of Blacks on their soil. When you seek the cause of the present troubles and future dangers of the Union, you almost always end up at this first fact, from no matter where you start.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3094">Men generally need to make great and constant efforts to create lasting evils; but there is one evil that enters into the world furtively. At first, you barely notice it amid the usual abuses of power; it begins with an individual whose name is not preserved by history; it is deposited like an accursed seed at some point in the soil; it then feeds on itself, spreads effortlessly, and grows naturally with the society that received it. This evil is slavery.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3095">Christianity had destroyed servitude; the Christians of the sixteenth century reestablished it; but they never allowed it in their social system other than as an exception, and they took care to restrict it to a single one of the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>550<span class="bracket">]</span></span> human races. They therefore gave humanity a wound not as extensive, but infinitely more difficult to heal.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1252" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1252_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3096">Two things must be carefully distinguished: slavery in itself and its consequences.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3097">The immediate evils produced by slavery were nearly the same among ancient peoples as they are among modern peoples, but the consequences of these evils were different. Among the ancients the slave belonged to the same race as his master, and often he was superior to him in education and in enlightenment.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1253" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1253_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">31</a> Liberty alone separated them; once liberty was granted, they easily blended.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3098">So the ancients had a very simple means to rid themselves of slavery and its consequences; this means was emancipation, and as soon as they used it in a general way, they succeeded.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1255" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1255_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>551<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3099">Not that the marks of servitude in antiquity did not still continue to exist for some time after servitude was destroyed. [{Real inequality was followed by social inequality.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3100">There is a natural prejudice that leads man to scorn the one who has been his inferior, long after he has become his equal; real inequality produced by fortune or law is always followed by an imaginary inequality that has its roots in mores; but among the ancients this secondary effect of slavery came to an end. The emancipated man so strongly resembled the men who were born free that it soon became impossible to distinguish him from them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3101">What was more difficult among the ancients was to change the law; what is more difficult among modern peoples is to change mores, and for us the real difficulty begins where in antiquity it ended.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3102">This happens because among modern peoples the non-material and transitory fact of slavery is combined in the most fatal way with the material and permanent fact of the difference of race. The memory of slavery dishonors the race, and race perpetuates the memory of slavery.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3103">There is not an African who came freely to the shores of the New World; from that it follows that all those who are found there today are slaves or emancipated. Thus the Negro, together with life, transmits to all of his descendants the external sign of his shame. Law can destroy servitude; but only God alone can make its mark disappear.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1256" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1256_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3104">The modern slave differs from the master not only in liberty, but also in origin. You can make the Negro free, but he remains in the position of a stranger vis-à-vis the European.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3105">That is still not all. In this man who is born in lowliness, in this stranger that slavery introduced among us, we scarcely acknowledge the general features of humanity. His face appears hideous to us, his intelligence seems limited to us, his tastes are base; we very nearly take him for an intermediate being between brute and man.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1257" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1257_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">32</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>552<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3106">So after abolishing slavery, modern peoples still have to destroy three prejudices much more elusive and more tenacious than slavery: the prejudice of the master, the prejudice of race, and finally the prejudice of the white.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3107">It is very difficult for us, who have had the good fortune to be born among men whom nature made our fellows and the law our equals; it is very difficult for us, I say, to understand what insurmountable distance separates the Negro of America from the European. But we can have a remote idea of it by reasoning by analogy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1258" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1258_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3108">We formerly saw among us great inequalities whose principles were only in legislation. What more fictitious than a purely legal inequality! What more contrary to the instinct of man than permanent differences established among men clearly similar! These differences have continued to exist for centuries however; they still continue to exist in a thousand places; everywhere they have left imaginary marks that time can scarcely erase. If the inequality created solely by laws is so difficult to uproot, how to destroy the one that seems to have its immutable foundations in nature itself?<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1259" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1259_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3109">As for me, when I consider what difficulty aristocratic bodies of whatever nature have merging with the mass of the people, and the extreme care that they take to preserve for centuries the imaginary barriers that separate them, I despair of seeing an aristocracy founded on visible and imperishable signs disappear.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1260" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1260_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3110">So those who hope that one day the Europeans will blend with the Negroes seem to me to entertain a chimera. My reason does not lead me to believe it, and I see nothing in the facts that indicate it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3111">Until now, wherever whites have been the most powerful, they have held Negroes in degradation or in slavery. Wherever Negroes have been the strongest, they have destroyed whites; it is the only accounting that might ever be possible between the two races.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3112">If I consider the United States of our day, I see clearly that in a certain part of the country the legal barrier that separates the two races is tending to fall, but not that of mores. I see slavery receding; the prejudice to which it gave birth is immovable.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3113">In the part of the Union where Negroes are no longer slaves, have they drawn nearer to whites? Every man who has lived in the United States will have noted that an opposite effect has been produced. [{In no part of the Union are the two races as separated as in New [England (ed.)] [v: the North].}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3114">Racial prejudice seems to me stronger in the states that have abolished slavery than in those where slavery still exists, and nowhere does it appear as intolerant as in the states where servitude has always been unknown.<span class="sup">[f]</span><a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1261" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1261_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>554<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3115">It is true that in the North of the Union the law allows Negroes and whites to contract legitimate unions;<span class="sup">[a]</span> but opinion declares vile the white who joins in marriage with a Negro woman; and it would be difficult to cite an example of such a deed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3116">In nearly all the states where slavery is abolished, the Negro has been given electoral rights;<span class="sup">[b]</span> but if he presents himself to vote, he risks his life.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1262" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1262_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a> Oppressed, he can make a complaint, but he finds only whites among his judges. The law opens the juror’s seat to him,<span class="sup">[c]</span> but prejudice pushes him away from it. His son is excluded from the school where the descendant of the European goes to be instructed. In the theaters he cannot, even at the price of gold, buy the right to sit next to the one who was his master;<span class="sup">[d]</span> in the hospitals he lies apart. The Black is allowed to beseech the same God as the whites, but not to pray to him at the same altar. He has his priests <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>555<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and his churches.<span class="sup">[e]</span> The gates of heaven are not closed to him: but inequality scarcely stops at the edge of the other world. When the Negro is no more, his bones are thrown aside, and the difference in conditions is found again even in the equality of death.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3117">Thus the Negro is free, but he is not able to share either the rights or the pleasures or the labors or the pains or even the tomb of the one whose equal he has been declared to be; he cannot meet him anywhere, either in life or in death.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3118">[{What miserable mockery this is.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3119">In the South where slavery still exists, Negroes are less carefully kept aside; they sometimes share the labors of whites and their pleasures; to a certain point they are permitted to mix with them. Legislation is more harsh in their regard; habits are more tolerant and milder.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3120">In the South the master is not afraid to raise his slave up to his level, because he knows that if he wishes he will always be able to throw him back into the dust. In the North the white no longer distinctly sees the barrier that should separate him from a degraded race, and he withdraws with all the more care from the Negro because he fears that someday he will merge with him.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3121">With the American of the South, nature sometimes reasserts its rights and for a moment reestablishes equality between Blacks and whites. In the North pride silences even the most imperious passion of man. The American of the North would perhaps consent to make the Negro woman the temporary companion of his pleasures if the legislators had declared that she must not aspire to share his bed; but she is able to become his wife, and he withdraws from her with a kind of horror.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3122">This is how in the United States the prejudice that pushes Negroes away seems to increase proportionately as Negroes cease to be slaves, and how inequality becomes imprinted in the mores as it fades in the laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3123">But if the relative position of the two races that inhabit the United States is as I have just shown, why have the Americans abolished slavery in the north of the Union, why do they keep it in the south, and what causes them to aggravate its rigors there?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3124">It is easy to answer. Slavery is being destroyed in the United States not in the interest of the Negroes, but in that of the whites.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3126">The first Negroes were imported into Virginia about the year 1621.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1263" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1263_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">33</a> So in America, as in all the rest of the world, servitude was born in the South. From there it gained ground step by step; but as slavery moved up toward the North the number of slaves kept decreasing;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1264" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1264_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">34</a> there were always very few slaves in New England.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1265" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1265_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3127">The colonies were founded; a century had already passed, and an extraordinary fact began to strike everyone’s attention. The provinces that possessed no slaves so to speak grew in population, in wealth, and in well-being more rapidly than those that had them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3128">In the first, however, the inhabitant was forced to cultivate the soil himself or to hire the services of another man; in the second, he found at his disposal workers whose efforts were not paid. So there was work and expense on one side, leisure and economy on the other. But the advantage remained with the first.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3129">This result seemed all the more difficult to explain because the emigrants, all belonging to the same European race, had the same habits, the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>557<span class="bracket">]</span></span> same civilization, the same laws, and differed only in slightly perceptible nuances.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3130">Time continued to march. Leaving the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, the Anglo-Americans [{Europeans}] plunged every day further into the uninhabited areas of the West; there they encountered new terrains and climates; they had to conquer obstacles of different kinds; their races mingled, men of the South went toward the North, men of the North descended toward the South. Among all these causes, the same fact was reproduced at each step; and in general the colony in which there were no slaves became more populated and more prosperous than the one in which slavery was in force.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3131">So as things advanced you began to see that slavery, so cruel to the slave, was deadly to the master.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3132">But this truth was conclusively proved on the banks of the Ohio.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3133">The river that the Indians had named the Ohio, or the Beautiful River par excellence, waters one of the most magnificent valleys that man has ever made his dwelling-place. Rolling terrain extends on the two banks of the Ohio where the soil offers inexhaustible treasures to the plowman every day; on the two banks the air is equally healthy and the climate temperate; each one of them forms the extreme boundary of a vast state. On the left the state that follows the thousand curves made by the Ohio in its course is called Kentucky; the other borrowed the name of the river itself. The two states differ only on one single point: Kentucky allowed slaves, the state of Ohio cast all of them out.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1266" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1266_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">35</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3134">So the traveler who, placed in the middle of the Ohio, allows himself to be carried along by the current until the river flows into the Mississippi navigates, so to speak, between liberty and servitude; and he has only to glance around him to judge in an instant which one is most favorable to humanity.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3135">On the left bank of the river, the population is scattered; from time to time you see a gang of slaves with a carefree air crossing fields half deserted; the primeval forest constantly reappears; you would say that society <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>558<span class="bracket">]</span></span> is asleep; man seems idle; it is nature that offers the image of activity and life.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3136">From the right bank arises, in contrast, a confused murmur that proclaims from afar the presence of industry; rich crops cover the fields; elegant dwellings announce the taste and the attentions of the plowman; on all sides comfort is revealed; man seems rich and content: he is working.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1267" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1267_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">36</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3137">The state of Kentucky was founded in 1775; the state of Ohio was founded only twelve years later:<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1268" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1268_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a> twelve years in America is more than a half-century in Europe. Today the population of Ohio already exceeds that of Kentucky by 250,000 inhabitants.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1269" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1269_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">37</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3138">These diverse effects of slavery and of liberty are easily understood; they are sufficient to explain clearly the differences that are found between ancient civilization and that of today.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3139">On the left bank of the Ohio work merges with the idea of slavery; on the right bank, with that of well-being and progress; there it is debased, here it is honored. On the left bank of the river you cannot find workers belonging to the white race; they would be afraid of resembling slaves; you must rely on the efforts of Negroes. On the right bank you would look in vain for someone idle; the white extends his activity and his intelligence to all undertakings.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3140">Thus the men who in Kentucky are charged with exploiting the natural riches of the soil have neither enthusiasm nor enlightenment; while those who could have these two things do nothing or go into Ohio in order to make use of their industry and to be able to exercise it without shame.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3141">It is true that in Kentucky masters make slaves work without being <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>559<span class="bracket">]</span></span> obliged to pay them, but they gain little benefit from their efforts, while the money that they would have given to free laborers would have been repaid with great interest by the value of their work.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1270" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1270_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3142">The free worker is paid, but he works faster than the slave, and rapidity of execution is one of the great elements of economy. The white sells his help, but you buy it only when it is useful; the Black has nothing to claim as the price for his services, but you are obliged to feed him all the time; he must be sustained in his old age as in his mature years, in his unproductive childhood as during the fruitful years of his youth, during illness as in health. It is therefore only by paying that you obtain the work of these two men: the free worker receives a salary; the slave, an education, food, care, clothing. The money that the master spends for the maintenance of the slave melts away little by little and on small particulars; you hardly notice it. The salary that you give to the worker is given all at once, and it seems to enrich only the one who receives it; but in reality the slave has cost more than the free man, and his efforts have been less productive.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1271" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1271_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">38</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3143">The influence of slavery extends still further; it penetrates even into the very soul of the master, and gives his ideas and his tastes a particular direction.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3144">On the two banks of the Ohio nature has given man an enterprising and energetic character; but on each side of the river he makes a different use of this common quality.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>560<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3145">The white of the right bank, obliged to live by his own efforts, made material well-being the principal goal of his existence; and since the country that he inhabits presents inexhaustible resources to his industry, and offers constantly recurring lures to his activity, his ardor to acquire has surpassed the ordinary limits of human cupidity. You see him, tormented by the desire for wealth, go boldly down all the paths that fortune opens to him; he becomes indiscriminately seaman, pioneer, manufacturer, farmer, bearing with an equal constancy the work or the dangers attached to these different professions. There is something marvelous in the resources of his genius, and a sort of heroism in his greediness for gain.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3146">The American of the left bank scorns not only work, but all the enterprises that work brings to success; living in idle comfort, he has the tastes of idle men; money has lost a part of its value in his eyes; he pursues fortune less than excitement and pleasure, and he expends to these ends the energy that his neighbor deploys elsewhere; he passionately loves the hunt and war; he takes pleasure in the most violent exercises of the body; the use of arms is familiar to him, and from his childhood he has learned to risk his life in single combat. So slavery not only prevents whites from making a fortune, it turns them away from wanting to do so.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3147">The same causes, operating continuously for two centuries in opposite directions in the English colonies of North America, have ended by creating a prodigious difference between the commercial capacity of the Southerner and that of the Northerner. Today only the North has ships, factories, railroads and canals.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3148">This difference is noticeable not only in comparing the North and the South, but in comparing the inhabitants of the South among themselves. Nearly all the men in the southernmost states of the Union who devote themselves to commercial enterprises and seek to utilize slavery have come from the North; each day the men of the North spread into this part of the American territory where there is less competition for them to fear; there they discover resources that the inhabitants did not notice, and submitting to a system that they disapprove of, they succeed in turning it to better account than those who, having established the system, still uphold it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3149">If I wanted to push the parallel further, I would easily prove that nearly <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>561<span class="bracket">]</span></span> all the differences that are noticeable between the character of the Americans in the South and the North are born out of slavery; but this would go beyond my subject. I am trying at this moment to find out not what all the effects of servitude are, but what effects servitude produces on the material prosperity of those who have accepted it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3150">[≠What I limit myself to saying at this moment is this. The Americans are, of all modern peoples, those who have pushed equality and inequality furthest among men. They have combined universal suffrage and servitude. They seem to have wanted to prove in this way the advantages of equality by opposite arguments. It is claimed that the Americans, by establishing universal suffrage and the dogma of sovereignty [of the people], have made clear to the world the advantages of equality. As for me, I think that they have above all proved this by establishing servitude, and I find that they establish the advantages of equality much less by democracy than by slavery.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3151">This influence of slavery on the production of wealth could only be very imperfectly known by antiquity. Servitude existed then in all the civilized world, and the peoples who did not know it were barbarians.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3152">So Christianity destroyed slavery only by asserting the rights of slaves; today you can attack it in the name of the master. On this point interest and morality are in agreement.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1272" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1272_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>562<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3153">As these truths manifested themselves in the United States, you saw slavery retreat little by little before the light of experience.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3154">Servitude had begun in the South and afterward spread toward the North; today it is withdrawing. Liberty, starting in the North, is moving without stopping toward the South. Among the large states Pennsylvania today forms the extreme limit of slavery to the North, but even within these limits it is shaken; Maryland, which is immediately below Pennsylvania, is preparing daily to do without it, and Virginia, which comes after Maryland, is already debating its utility and its dangers.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1273" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1273_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">39</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>563<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3155">No great change in human institutions takes place without discovering, among the causes of this change, the inheritance law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3156">When unequal division ruled in the South, each family was represented by a rich man who did not feel the need any more than he had the taste for work; the members of his family that the law had excluded from the common inheritance lived around him in the same manner, as so many parasitic plants; you then saw in all the families of the South what you still see today in the noble families of certain countries of Europe, where the younger sons, without having the same wealth as the eldest son, remain as idle as he. This similar effect was produced in America and in Europe by entirely analogous causes. In the South of the United States the entire race of whites formed an aristocratic body at the head of which stood a certain number of privileged individuals whose wealth was permanent and whose leisure was inherited.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1274" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1274_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a> These leaders of the American nobility perpetuated the traditional prejudices of the white race in the body that they represented, and maintained the honorable character of idleness. Within this aristocracy you could find poor men, but not workers; poverty there seemed preferable to industry; so Black workers and slaves encountered no competitors, and whatever opinion you might have about the utility of their efforts you very much had to use them, since they were the only ones available.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3157">From the moment when the law of inheritance was abolished all fortunes began to diminish simultaneously, all families moved in the same way closer to the state in which work becomes necessary to existence; many among them entirely disappeared; all foresaw the moment when it would be necessary for each man to provide for his needs by himself. Today you still see the rich, but they no longer form a compact and hereditary body; they were <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>564<span class="bracket">]</span></span> not able to adopt a spirit, to persevere there, and to make it penetrate into all ranks. So the prejudice that condemned work began to be abandoned by common accord; there were more poor, and the poor were able without being ashamed to concern themselves with the means of gaining their livelihood. Thus one of the most immediate effects of equal division was to create a class of free workers. From the moment when the free worker entered into competition with the slave, the inferiority of the latter made itself felt, and slavery was attacked in its very essence, which is the interest of the master.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3158">As slavery retreats, the Black race follows it in its backward march, and returns with it toward the tropics from where it originally came.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3159">This can seem extraordinary at first glance; we will soon understand it. By abolishing the principle of servitude, the Americans do not free the slaves.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3160">Perhaps what is about to follow would be difficult to understand if I did not cite an example. I will choose that of the state of New York. In 1788, the state of New York prohibits the sale of slaves within it. This was a roundabout way of prohibiting importation. From that moment the number of Negroes no longer grows except by the natural increase of the Black population. Eight years later a more decisive measure is taken, and it is declared that from July 4, 1799 onward, all children born of slave parents will be free. All means of increase are then closed; there are still slaves, but you can say that servitude no longer exists.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3161">From the period when a state of the North also prohibits the importation of slaves, Blacks are no longer removed from the South to be transported to that state.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3162">From the moment when a state of the North forbids the sale of Negroes, the slave, no longer able to leave the hands of the one who owns him, becomes a burdensome property, and there is an interest in transporting him to the South.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3163">The day when a state of the North declares that the son of a slave will be born free, the slave loses a great part of his market value; for his posterity can no longer be part of the market, and again there is a great interest in transporting him to the South.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>565<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3164">Thus the same law prevents slaves from the South from coming to the North and pushes those of the North toward the South.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3165">But here is another cause more powerful than all those that I have just discussed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3166">As the number of slaves diminishes in a state, the need for free workers makes itself felt. As free workers take over industry, since the work of the slave is less productive, the slave becomes a second-rate or useless property, and again there is a great interest in exporting him to the South where competition is not to be feared.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3167">So the abolition of slavery does not bring the slave to liberty; it only makes him change masters. From the north he passes to the south.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3168">As for the emancipated Negroes and those who are born after slavery has been abolished, they do not leave the North to go to the South, but they find themselves vis-à-vis the Europeans in a position analogous to that of the natives; they remain half civilized and deprived of rights amid a population that is infinitely superior to them in wealth and enlightenment; they are exposed to the tyranny of laws<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1275" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1275_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">40</a> and to the intolerance of mores.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1276" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1276_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a> More unfortunate from a certain perspective than the Indians, they have against them the memories of slavery, and they cannot claim possession of a single piece of land; many succumb to their misery;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1277" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1277_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">41</a> others concentrate in the cities where, undertaking the roughest work, they lead a precarious and miserable existence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3169">Since the number of whites is increasing at twice the rate after the abolition of slavery, Blacks would soon be as if swallowed up amid the waves of a foreign population, even if the number of Negroes continued to grow in the same way as in the period when they were not yet free.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>566<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3170">A land cultivated by slaves is in general less populated than one cultivated by free men; America is, moreover, a new country; so at the moment when a state abolishes slavery, it is still only half full. Scarcely is servitude destroyed there and the need for free workers felt, than you see a crowd of hardy adventurers rushing in from all parts of the country; they come to profit from the new resources which are going to open to human industry. The land is divided among them; on each portion a family of whites settles and takes possession of it. It is also toward the free states that European emigration heads. What would the poor man of Europe do, coming to find comfort and happiness in the New World, if he went to inhabit a country where work was stained with shame?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3171">Thus the white population grows by its natural movement and at the same time by an immense emigration, while the Black population does not receive emigrants and becomes weaker. Soon the proportion that existed between the two races is reversed. The Negroes form nothing more than unfortunate remnants, a small, poor and wandering tribe lost in the middle of an immense people, master of the land; and nothing more is noticed of their presence except the injustices and the rigors to which they are subjected.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3172">In many of the states of the West the Negro race has never appeared; in all the states of the North it is disappearing. So the great question of the future is shrinking within a narrow circle; it thus becomes less formidable, but no easier to resolve.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3173">The further south you go, the more difficult it is to abolish slavery usefully. This results from several material causes that must be developed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3174">This first is climate: it is certain that as Europeans approach the tropics work becomes proportionately more difficult for them; many Americans even claim that below a certain latitude it ends up becoming fatal to them, while the Negro submits to it without dangers;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1278" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1278_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">42</a> but I do not think that <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>567<span class="bracket">]</span></span> this idea, so favorable to the laziness of the man of the South, is based on experience. It is not hotter in the South of the Union than in the south of Spain or of Italy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1279" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1279_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">43</a> Why would the European not be able to accomplish the same work there? And if slavery was abolished in Italy and in Spain without having the masters perish, why wouldn’t the same thing happen in the Union? So I do not believe that nature has forbidden the European of Georgia or of Florida, under pain of death, to draw their subsistence from the land themselves; but this work would assuredly be more painful and less productive for them than for the inhabitants of New England.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1280" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1280_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">44</a> With the free worker in the South losing in this way a part of his superiority over the slave, it is less useful to abolish slavery.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3175">All the plants of Europe grow in the North of the Union; the South has special products.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3176">It has been noted that slavery is an expensive means to cultivate cereal crops. Whoever grows wheat in a country where servitude is unknown normally keeps in his service only a small number of workers; at harvest time and during planting he brings together many others, it is true; but the latter live at his place only temporarily.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3177">To fill his warehouses or to sow his fields, the farmer who lives in a slave state is obliged to maintain throughout the entire year a great number of servants, whom he needs only during a few days; for, unlike free workers, slaves cannot, while working for themselves, wait for the moment when you must come to hire their labor. You must buy them in order to use them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3178">So slavery, apart from its general disadvantages, is naturally less applicable to countries where cereal crops are cultivated than to those where other products are harvested.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3179">The cultivation of tobacco, cotton and, above all, sugar cane requires, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>568<span class="bracket">]</span></span> on the contrary, constant attention. There you can employ women and children that you could not use in the cultivation of wheat. Thus slavery is naturally more appropriate to the country where the products that I have just named are grown.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3180">Tobacco, cotton, sugar cane grow only in the South; there they form the principal sources of the wealth of the country. By destroying slavery the men of the South would find themselves with these alternatives: either they would be forced to change their system of cultivation, and then they would enter into competition with the men of the North, more active and more experienced than they; or they would cultivate the same products without slaves, and then they would have to bear the competition of the other states of the South that would have retained slaves.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3181">Thus the South has particular reasons for keeping slavery that the North does not have.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1281" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1281_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3182">But here is another motive more powerful than all the others. The South would indeed be able, if really necessary, to abolish slavery; but how would the South rid itself of Blacks? In the North slavery and slaves are chased away at the same time. In the South you cannot hope to attain this double result at the same time.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3183">While proving that servitude was more natural and more advantageous in the South than in the North, I showed sufficiently that the number of slaves must be much greater there. The first Africans were brought into the South; that is where they have always arrived in greater number. As you go further south, the prejudice that holds idleness in honor gains power. In the states that are closest to the tropics there is not one white man who works. So Negroes are naturally more numerous in the South than in the North. Each day, as I said above, they become more numerous; for, in proportion as slavery is destroyed at one end of the Union, Negroes accumulate in the other. Thus the number of Blacks is increasing in the South, not only by the natural movement of the population, but also by the forced <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>569<span class="bracket">]</span></span> emigration of the Negroes of the North. The African race, to grow in this part of the Union, has reasons analogous to those that make the European race increase so quickly in the North.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3184">In the state of Maine there is one Negro for every three hundred inhabitants; in Massachusetts one for every one hundred; in the state of New York two for every one hundred; in Pennsylvania three; in Maryland thirty-four; forty-two in Virginia, and fifty-five finally in South Carolina.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1282" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1282_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">45</a> Such was the proportion of Blacks in relation to whites in the year 1830. But this proportion changes constantly: every day it becomes smaller in the North and greater in the South.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3185">It is clear that in the southernmost states of the Union you cannot abolish slavery as you have in the states of the North without running very great dangers that the latter did not have to fear.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3186">We have seen how the states of the North carefully handled the transition between slavery and liberty. They keep the present generation in irons and free future races; in this way Negroes are introduced into society only little by little, and while the man who could make bad use of his independence is retained in servitude, the one who can still learn the art of being free, before becoming master of himself, is liberated.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3187">It is difficult to apply this method to the South. When you declare that beginning at a certain time the son of the Negro will be free, you introduce the principle and the idea of liberty into the very heart of servitude; the Blacks who are kept in slavery by the legislator and who see their sons emerge from it are astonished by this unequal division that destiny makes between them; they become restless and angry. From that moment slavery has in their view lost the type of moral power that time and custom gave <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>570<span class="bracket">]</span></span> it; it is reduced to being nothing more than a visible abuse of force. [Thus the law that sets the son at liberty makes it more difficult to keep the father a slave.] The North had nothing to fear from this contrast, because in the North Blacks were small in number and whites very numerous. But if this first dawn of liberty came to break upon two million men at the same time, the oppressors would have to tremble.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1283" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1283_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3188">After emancipating the sons of their slaves, the Europeans of the South would soon be compelled to extend the same benefit to the entire Black race.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3189">In the North, as I said above, from the moment when slavery is abolished, and even from the moment when it becomes probable that the time of its abolition is approaching, a double movement takes place. Slaves leave the country to be transported more to the South; whites of the northern states and the emigrants from Europe rush to take their place.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3190">These two causes cannot work in the same way in the last states of the South. On the one hand, the mass of slaves is too great there to be able to <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>571<span class="bracket">]</span></span> hope to make them leave the country;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1284" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1284_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a> on the other hand, the Europeans and the Anglo-Americans of the North dread coming to live in a country where work has still not been rehabilitated. Moreover, they rightly regard the states where the proportion of Negroes surpasses or equals that of whites as threatened by great misfortunes, and they refrain from bringing their industry there.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3191">Thus by abolishing slavery, the men of the South would not succeed, like their brethren of the North, in making Negroes arrive gradually at liberty; they would not appreciably diminish the number of Blacks, and to hold them in check they would be alone. So in the course of a few years you would see a great people of free Negroes placed in the middle of a more or less equal nation of whites.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3192">The same abuses<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1285" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1285_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a> of power that maintain slavery today would then become the source of the greatest dangers that whites in the South would have to fear. Today the descendant of Europeans alone possesses the land; he is the absolute master of industry; he alone is rich, enlightened, armed. The Black possesses none of these advantages; but he can do without them, he is a slave. Once free, charged with watching over his own fate, can he remain deprived of all these things without dying? So what made the strength of the white, when slavery existed, exposes him to a thousand perils after slavery is abolished.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3193">Left in servitude, the Negro can be held in a state near that of the brute; free, he cannot be prevented from becoming educated enough to appreciate the extent of his ills and to catch sight of the remedy to them. There is, moreover, a singular principle of relative justice that is found very deeply buried in the human heart. Men are struck much more by the inequality that exists within the interior of the same class than by the inequalities that are noticed among different classes. Slavery is understood; but how to imagine <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>572<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the existence of several million citizens eternally bent down by infamy and given over to hereditary miseries? In the North a population of emancipated Negroes experiences these evils and feels these injustices; but it is weak and reduced; in the South it would be numerous and strong.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3194">From the moment that you allow whites and emancipated Negroes to be placed on the same soil as peoples who are strangers to each other, you will understand without difficulty that there are only two possibilities in the future: Negroes and whites must either blend entirely or separate.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3195">I have already expressed my conviction about the first means.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1286" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1286_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">46</a> I do not think that the white race and the Black race will come to live on an equal footing anywhere.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3196">But I believe that the difficulty will be even greater in the United States than anywhere else.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1287" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1287_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a> If a man happens to stand outside of the prejudices of religion, of country, of race, and this man is king, he can work surprising revolutions in society. An entire people cannot so to speak rise above itself in this way.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3197">A despot coming to join the Americans and their former slaves under the same yoke would perhaps succeed in mixing them together; as long as the American democracy remains at the head of affairs, no one will dare to attempt such an undertaking, and you can anticipate that, the more the whites of the United States are free, the more they will seek to separate themselves.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1288" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1288_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">47</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3198">I said elsewhere that the true link between the European and the Indian was the half-breed; in the same way, the true transition between the white <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>573<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and the Negro is the mulatto. Wherever there is a very great number of mulattos, the fusion between the two races is not impossible.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3199">There are parts of America where the European and the Negro have so crossed that it is difficult to meet a man who is completely white or completely Black. Having reached this point, the two races can really be said to have mingled; or rather, in their place, a third has appeared that takes after the two without being precisely either the one or the other.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3200">Of all Europeans the English are the ones who have least mingled their blood with that of the Negroes. You see more mulattos in the South of the Union than in the North, but infinitely fewer than in any other European colony. Mulattos are very few in the United States; they have no strength by themselves, and in the quarrels between the races they ordinarily make common cause with the whites. This is how in Europe you often see the lackeys of great lords put on nobility with the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3201">This pride of origin, natural to the English, has been singularly increased further among the Americans by the individual pride given birth by democratic liberty. The white man of the United States is proud of his race and proud of himself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3202">Besides, since whites and Negroes do not come to mingle in the North of the Union, how would they mingle in the South? Can you suppose for one moment that the American of the South, placed as he will always be between the white man in all his physical and moral superiority and the Negro, can ever think of mixing with the latter? The American of the South has two energetic passions that will always lead him to separate himself: he will be afraid of resembling the Negro, his former slave, and of descending below the white, his neighbor.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3203">If it were absolutely necessary to foretell the future, I would say that in the probable course of things the abolition of slavery in the South will make the repugnance that the white population feels there for the Blacks grow. I base this opinion on what I have already noted analogously in the North. I said that the white men of the North withdraw from Negroes all the more carefully as the legislator blurs the legal separation that should exist between them. Why would it not be the same in the South? In the North when whites are afraid of ending by blending with Blacks, they fear an imaginary <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>574<span class="bracket">]</span></span> danger. In the South where the danger would be real, I cannot believe that the fear would be less.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1289" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1289_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3204">If, on the one hand, you recognize (and the fact is not doubtful) that in the extreme South Blacks are constantly accumulating and growing faster than whites; if, on the other hand, you concede that it is impossible to foresee the time when Blacks and whites will come to mingle and to draw the same advantages from the state of society, must you not conclude that in the states of the South Blacks and whites will sooner or later end by getting into a struggle?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3205">What will the final result of this struggle be?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3206">You will easily understand that on this point you must confine yourself to vague conjectures. With difficulty the human mind manages in a way to draw a great circle around the future; but within this circle chance, which escapes all efforts, is in constant motion. In the portrait of the future chance always forms the obscure point where the sight of intelligence cannot penetrate. What you can say is this: in the Antilles it is the white race that seems destined to succumb; on the continent, the Black race.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3207">In the Antilles whites are isolated in the middle of an immense population of Blacks;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1290" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1290_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> on the continent Blacks are placed between the sea and an innumerable people who already extend above them as a compact mass, from the frozen areas of Canada to the borders of Virginia, from the banks <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>575<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of the Mississippi to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. If the whites of North America remain united, it is difficult to believe that Negroes can escape the destruction that threatens them; they will succumb by sword or misery. But the Black populations accumulated along the Gulf of Mexico have chances for salvation if the struggle between the two races comes about when the American confederation has dissolved. Once the federal link is broken, the men of the South would be wrong to count on lasting support from their brothers of the North. The latter know that the danger can never reach them; if a positive duty does not compel them to march to the aid of the South, you can foresee that the sympathies of race will be powerless.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3208">Whatever the period of the struggle may be, the whites of the South left to themselves will moreover present themselves in the contest with an immense superiority of enlightenment and means; but the Blacks will have for them numbers and the energy of despair. Those are great resources when you have weapons in hand. Perhaps what happened to the Moors of Spain will then happen to the white race of the South [(something not very probable, it is true)]. After occupying the country for centuries, it will finally withdraw little by little toward the country from which its ancestors came in the past, abandoning to the Negroes the possession of a country that Providence seems to intend for the latter, since they live there without difficulty and work more easily there than whites.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3209">The danger, more or less remote but inevitable, of a struggle between the Blacks and whites who populate the South of the Union presents itself constantly as a painful dream to the imagination of the Americans. The inhabitants of the North talk daily about these dangers, although they have nothing directly to fear from them. They seek in vain to find a means to ward off the misfortunes that they foresee.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3210">In the states of the South the inhabitants are silent. They do not speak about the future with strangers; they avoid talking about it with friends; each person hides it so to speak from himself. The silence of the South has something more frightening about it than the noisy fears of the North.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3211">This general preoccupation of minds has given birth to an almost unknown enterprise that can change the fate of one part of the human race.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>576<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3212">Fearing the dangers that I have just described, a certain number of American citizens gather as a society with the goal of exporting at their expense to the coasts of Guinea the free Negroes who would like to escape the tyranny that weighs upon them.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1291" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1291_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">48</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3213">In 1820, the society that I am speaking about succeeded in founding in Africa, at 7 degrees of north latitude, a settlement to which it gave the name <span class="ital">Liberia.</span><a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1292" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1292_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> The latest news announced that two thousand five hundred Negroes were already gathered at this place. Transported to their former country, the Blacks have introduced American institutions there. Liberia has a representative system, Negro jurors, Negro magistrates, Negro priests; you see churches and newspapers there, and by a singular turn of the vicissitudes of this world whites are forbidden to settle within its walls.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1293" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1293_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">49</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3214">There certainly is a strange twist of fortune! Two centuries have passed since the day when the inhabitant of Europe undertook to carry Negroes from their family and their country to transport them to the shores of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>577<span class="bracket">]</span></span> North America. Today you meet the European busy again carting the descendants of these very Negroes across the Atlantic Ocean in order to take them back to the land from which he had once uprooted their fathers. Barbarians have drawn the enlightenment of civilization from within servitude and have learned in slavery the art of being free.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1294" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1294_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3215">Until today Africa was closed to the arts and sciences of whites. The enlightenment of Europe, imported by Africans, will perhaps penetrate there. So there is a beautiful and great idea in the founding of Liberia; but the idea, which can become so fruitful for the Old World, is sterile for the New.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3216">In twelve years the Society for the colonization of Blacks has transported to Africa two thousand five hundred Negroes. During the same time period, about seven hundred thousand of them were born in the United States.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3217">If the colony of Liberia were in the position to receive each year thousands of new inhabitants, and the latter in a condition to be brought there usefully; if the Union took the place of the Society, and if annually it used its riches<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1295" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1295_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">50</a> and its ships to export Negroes to Africa, it still would not be able to balance just the natural increase of the population among the Blacks; and by not removing each year as many men as those born, it would not even manage to suspend the development of the evil that is growing each day in its bosom.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1296" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1296_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">51</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3218">The Negro race will no longer leave the shores of the American continent, where the passions and the vices of Europe made it come; it will disappear from the New World only by ceasing to exist. The inhabitants <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>578<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of the United States can postpone the misfortunes that they fear, but they cannot today destroy the cause of them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3219">I am obliged to admit that I do not consider the abolition of slavery as a means to delay in the states of the South the struggle of the two races.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1297" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1297_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3220">The Negroes can remain slaves for a long time without complaining; but once among the number of free men, they will soon become indignant about being deprived of nearly all the rights of citizens; and not able to become the equals of whites, they will not take long to prove to be their enemies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3221">In the North emancipating the slaves was all profit; you rid yourself in this way of slavery, without having anything to fear from free Negroes. The latter were too few ever to claim their rights. It is not the same in the South.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3222">The question of slavery was for the masters in the North a commercial and manufacturing question; in the South it is a question of life or death. So you must not confuse slavery in the North and in the South.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3223">God keep me from trying, like certain American authors, to justify the principle of the servitude of Negroes; I am only saying that all those who have allowed this painful principle in the past are not equally free to abandon it today.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3224">I confess that when I consider the state of the South, I discover for the white race that inhabits these countries only two ways to act: to free the Negroes and combine with them; to remain separated from them and hold them in slavery as long as possible.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1298" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1298_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a> The middle terms seem to me to lead shortly to the most horrible of all civil wars, and perhaps to the ruin of one of the two races.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3225">The Americans of the South envisage the question from this point of view, and they act accordingly. Not wanting to blend together with the Negroes, they do not want to set them free.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>579<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3226">It is not that all the inhabitants of the South regard slavery as necessary to the wealth of the master; on this point many among them agree with the men of the North, and readily admit with the latter that servitude is an evil; but they think that this evil must be maintained in order to live.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3227">Enlightenment, by increasing in the South, made the inhabitants of this part of the territory see that slavery is harmful to the master, and this same enlightenment shows them, more clearly than they had seen until then, the near impossibility of destroying it. A singular contrast results. Slavery becomes established more and more in the laws, as its usefulness is more disputed; and while its principle is gradually abolished in the North, in the South more and more rigorous consequences are drawn from this very principle.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3228">Today the legislation of the states of the South relative to slaves presents a kind of unheard of atrocity, and by itself alone it reveals some profound disturbance in the laws of humanity. It is enough to read the legislation of the states of the South to judge the desperate position of the two races that inhabit them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3229">It is not that the Americans of this part of the Union have exactly increased the rigors of servitude; they have, on the contrary, made the physical lot of the slaves milder. The ancients knew only chains and death to maintain slavery; the Americans of the South of the Union have found more intellectual guarantees for the continuance of their power. They have, if I many express myself in this way, spiritualized despotism and violence. In antiquity they tried to prevent the slave from breaking his chains; today we have undertaken to remove his desire to do so.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3230">The ancients chained the body of the slave, but they left his mind free and allowed him to become enlightened. In that they were consistent with themselves; then slavery had a natural way out: from one day to another the slave could become free and equal to his master.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3231">The Americans of the South, who do not think that at any time the Negroes can blend with them, have forbidden, under severe penalties, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>580<span class="bracket">]</span></span> teaching them to read and write.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1299" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1299_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a> Not wanting to raise them to their level, they hold them as close as possible to the brute.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1300" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1300_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3232">In all times the hope for liberty had been placed within slavery in order to soften its rigors.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3233">The Americans of the South have understood that emancipation always presented dangers when the emancipated person could not one day come to be assimilated with the master. To give a man liberty and leave him in misery and disgrace, that is to do what, if not to provide a future leader of a slave revolt? It had already been noted for a long time, moreover, that the presence of the free Negro cast a vague restlessness deep within the soul of those who were not free, and made the idea of their rights penetrate their soul like an uncertain glimmer. The Americans of the South have in most cases removed from the masters the ability to emancipate.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1301" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1301_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">52</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3234">I met in the South<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1302" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1302_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> of the Union an old man who formerly had lived in an illegitimate union with one of his Negro women. He had had several children with her, who coming into the world became slaves of their father. Several times the latter had thought to bequeath them at least liberty, but years had gone by before he was able to overcome the obstacles raised to emancipation by the legislator. During this time old age came, and he was about to die. He then imagined his sons led from market to market and passing from paternal authority to the rod of a stranger. These horrible images threw his dying imagination into delirium. I saw him prey to the agonies of despair, and I then understood how nature knew how to avenge the wounds done to it by laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3235">These evils are awful, without doubt; but are they not the foreseeable and necessary consequence of the very principle of servitude among modern peoples?</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>581<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3236">From the moment when Europeans took their slaves from within a race of men different from their own, that many among them considered as inferior to other human races, and with which all envisaged with horror the idea of ever assimilating, they supposed slavery to be eternal; for, between the extreme inequality that servitude creates and the complete equality that independence naturally produces among men, there is no intermediate lasting state. The Europeans vaguely sensed this truth, but without admitting it. Every time it concerned Negroes, you saw the Europeans obey sometimes their interest or their pride, sometimes their pity. Toward the Black they violated all the rights of humanity, and then they instructed him in the value and inviolability of these rights. They opened their ranks to their slaves, and when the latter attempted to enter, they chased them away in disgrace. Wanting servitude, the Europeans allowed themselves to be led despite themselves or without their knowing toward liberty, without having the courage of being either completely iniquitous or entirely just.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3237">If it is impossible to foresee a period when the Americans of the South will mix their blood with that of the Negroes, can they, without exposing themselves to perishing, allow the latter to attain liberty? And if, in order to save their own race, they are obliged to want to keep them in chains, must you not excuse them for taking the most effective means to succeed in doing so?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3238">What is happening in the South of the Union seems to me at the very same time the most horrible and the most natural consequence of slavery. When I see the order of nature overturned, when I hear humanity cry out and struggle in vain under the laws, I admit that I do not find the indignation to condemn the men of today, authors of these outrages; but I summon up all of my hatred against those who after more than a thousand years of equality introduced servitude again into the world.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3239">Whatever the efforts of the Americans of the South to keep slavery, moreover, they will not succeed forever. Slavery, squeezed into a single point of the globe, attacked by Christianity as unjust, by political economy as fatal; slavery, amid the democratic liberty and the enlightenment of our age, is not an institution that can endure. It will end by the deed of the slave or by that of the master. In both cases, great misfortunes must be expected.</p>

I do not intend to try to find out on what bases these new Unions would come to be established; what I want to show are the causes that can lead to the dismemberment of the current confederation.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3243">To succeed I am going to be obliged to go over again some of the roads that I have previously traveled. I will have to review several subjects that are already known. I know that by acting in this way I am exposing myself to the reproaches of the reader; but the importance of the matter that remains for me to treat is my excuse. I prefer to repeat myself sometimes than not to be understood, and I prefer to harm the author rather than the subject.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3244">The law-makers who drew up the Constitution of 1789 tried hard to give the federal power a separate existence and a preponderant strength.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3245">But they were limited by the very conditions of the problem that they had to resolve. They had not been charged with constituting the government of a single people, but with regulating the association of several peoples; and whatever their desires, they always had to end up dividing the exercise of sovereignty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3246">[≠In this division the law-makers of the Union found themselves still enclosed in a circle out of which they were not free to go.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3247">The conditions of the division were fixed in advance and by the very nature of things. To the Union reverted the direction of all general interests, to the states the government of all special [v: provincial] interests.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3248">The portion of the Union in this division of sovereignty seems at first view greater than that of the states; and in actual fact it is the smallest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3249">The general interests of the country touch its inhabitants only from time to time. The interests of locality, every day. The government of the Union has more power than that of the states, but you rarely feel it act. The provincial government does smaller things, but it never rests. The one assures the independence and the greatness of the country, something that does not immediately touch upon individual well-being; the other regulates liberty, fortune, life, the entire future of each citizen.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3250">So true political life is found in the state and not in the Union. Americans <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>584<span class="bracket">]</span></span> are attached to the Union by principle, to their state by sentiment and by instinct. They must in a way rise above themselves in order to sustain federal sovereignty against that of the states.≠]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1304" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1304_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3251">In order to understand well what the consequences of the division were, it is necessary to make a short distinction between the acts of sovereignty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3252">There are matters that are national by their nature, that is to say that are related only to the nation taken as a body, and can be confided only to the men or to the assembly that represents most completely the entire nation. I will put in this number war and diplomacy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3253">There are others that are provincial by their nature, that is to say that are related to certain localities and can be appropriately treated only in the locality itself. Such is the budget of towns.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3254">Finally, matters are found that have a mixed nature: they are national in that they interest all of the individuals who make up the nation; they are provincial in that there is no necessity that the nation itself provides for it. These are, for example, the rights that regulate the civil and political state of the citizens. There is no social state without civil and political rights. So these rights interest all citizens equally; but it is not always necessary to the existence and to the prosperity of the nation that these rights be uniform, and consequently that they be regulated by the central power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3255">So among the matters that sovereignty deals with,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1305" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1305_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a> there are two necessary <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>585<span class="bracket">]</span></span> categories; you find them again in all well-constituted societies, whatever the base, moreover, on which the social pact has been established.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3256">Between these two extreme points are placed, like a floating mass, general but non-national matters that I have called mixed. Since these matters are neither exclusively national nor entirely provincial, the care of providing for them can be attributed to the national government or to the provincial government, following the conventions of those who are becoming associated, without missing the purpose of the association.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3257">Most often simple individuals unite in order to form the sovereign power and their combination makes up a people. Above the general government they have given themselves you then find only individual strengths or collective powers, each of which represents a very minimal fraction of the sovereign power. Then as well it is the general government that is most naturally called to regulate not only matters national by their essence, but the greatest portion of the mixed matters that I already mentioned. The localities are reduced to the portion of sovereignty that is indispensable to their well-being.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3258">Sometimes, by a fact prior to the association, the sovereign power is composed of already organized political bodies; then it happens that the provincial government takes charge of providing not only for the matters exclusively provincial by their nature, but also for all or part of the mixed <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>586<span class="bracket">]</span></span> matters of which it was just a question. This is because the confederated nations, which were themselves sovereign powers before their union, and which, although they are united, continue to represent a very considerable fraction of the sovereign power, intended to cede to the general government only the exercise of the rights indispensable to the union.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1306" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1306_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3259">When the national government, apart from the prerogatives inherent in its nature, finds itself vested with the right to regulate the mixed matters of sovereignty, it possesses a preponderant strength. Not only does it have many rights, but all the rights that it does not have are at its mercy, and it is to be feared that it will go so far as to take away from the provincial governments their natural and necessary prerogatives.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1307" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1307_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3260">When it is, on the contrary, the provincial government that finds itself vested with the right to regulate the mixed matters, an opposite tendency reigns in society. Preponderant strength then resides in the province, not <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>587<span class="bracket">]</span></span> in the nation; and you must fear that the national government will end up being stripped of privileges necessary to its existence.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1308" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1308_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">q</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3261">So single peoples are naturally led toward centralization, and confederations toward dismemberment.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1309" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1309_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3262">It only remains to apply these general ideas to the American Union.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3263">To the particular states reverted inevitably the right to regulate purely provincial matters.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3264">In addition these same states retained that of fixing the civil and political capacity of citizens, of regulating the relationships of men with each other, and of administering justice to them; rights that are general in their nature, but that do not necessarily belong to the national government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3265">We have seen that to the government of the Union was delegated the power to command in the name of the entire nation in cases where the nation would have to act as one and the same individual. It represented the nation vis-à-vis foreigners; it led the common forces against the common enemy. In a word it was concerned with matters that I have called exclusively national.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3266">In this division of the rights of sovereignty the part of the Union still seems at first glance greater than that of the states; a slightly more thorough examination demonstrates that in fact it is less.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>588<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3267">[≠The Union is an almost imaginary being that is not easily apparent to the senses≠.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3268">The government of the Union executes more vast enterprises, but you rarely feel it act. The provincial government does smaller things, but it never rests and reveals its existence at each instant.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3269">The government of the Union watches over the general interests of the country; but the general interests of a people have only a debatable influence on individual happiness.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3270">The affairs of the province, in contrast, visibly influence the well-being of those who inhabit it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3271">The Union assures the independence and the greatness of the nation, things that do not immediately touch individuals. The state maintains the liberty, regulates the rights, guarantees the fortune, assures the life, the entire future of each citizen.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3272">The federal government is placed at a great distance from its subjects; the provincial government is within reach of all. It is enough to raise your voice in order to be heard by it. The central government has for it the passions of a few superior men who aspire to lead it; on the side of the provincial government is found the interest of second-rate men who only hope to obtain power in their state; and it is these who, placed near the people, exercise the most power over them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3273">So the Americans have much more to expect and to fear from the state than from the Union; and following the natural march of the human heart, they must be attached much more intensely to the first than to the second.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3274">[≠But men, whatever you say, are not led only by interests; they obey habits and sentiments.≠</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3275">{True patriotism remained with the state and did not pass to the Union. The state has an ancient existence, the Union is comparatively a new thing.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3276">In this habits and sentiments are in agreement with interests.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3277">When a compact nation divides its sovereignty and reaches the state of confederation, memories, customs, habits struggle for a long time against the laws and give the central government a strength that the latter deny it. When confederated peoples unite in a single sovereignty, the same causes act in the opposite direction. I do not doubt that if France became a confederated <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>589<span class="bracket">]</span></span> republic like that of the United States, the government would at first show itself to be more energetic than that of the Union; and if the Union constituted itself as a monarchy like France, I think that the American government would remain for some time weaker than ours. At the moment when national life was created among the Anglo-Americans, provincial existence was already old, necessary relationships were established between the towns and individuals of the same states; you were accustomed there to considering certain matters from a common point of view, and to dealing exclusively with certain enterprises as representing a special interest.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1310" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1310_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3278">The Union is an immense body that offers to patriotism a vague object to embrace. The state has settled forms and circumscribed limits; it represents a certain number of things known and dear to those who inhabit it. It blends with the very image of the land, is identified with property, with family, with memories of the past, with the work of the present, with dreams of the future. So patriotism, which most often is only an extension of individual egoism, has remained with the state and has not so to speak passed to the Union.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3279">Thus interests, habits, and sentiments unite to concentrate true political life in the state, and not in the Union.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3280">You can easily judge the difference in the strength of the two governments by seeing each of them move within the circle of its power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3281">Every time that a state government addresses itself to a man or to an <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>590<span class="bracket">]</span></span> association of men its language is clear and imperative; it is the same with the federal government when it is speaking to individuals; but as soon as it finds itself facing a state, it begins to talk at length: it explains its motives and justifies its conduct; it argues, advises, hardly ever commands. If doubts arise about the limits of the constitutional powers of each government, the provincial government claims its right with boldness and takes prompt and energetic measures to sustain it. During this time the government of the Union reasons; it appeals to the good sense of the nation, to its interests, to its glory; it temporizes, negotiates; only when reduced to the last extremity does it finally determine to act. At first view you could believe that it is the provincial government that is armed with the strength of the whole nation and that Congress represents a state.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3282">So the federal government, despite the efforts of those who constituted it, is, as I have already said elsewhere, by its very nature a weak government that more than any other needs the free support of the governed in order to subsist.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3283">It is easy to see that its object is to realize with ease the will that the states have to remain united. This first condition fulfilled, it is wise, strong and agile. It has been organized in such a way as usually to encounter only individuals before it and to overcome easily the resistance that some would like to oppose to the common will; but the federal government has not been established with the expectation that the states or several among them would cease to want to be united.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3284">If the sovereignty of the Union today entered into a struggle with that of the states, you can easily foresee that it would succumb; I doubt even that the battle would ever be engaged in a serious way.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1311" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1311_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a> Every time that an obstinate resistance is put up against the federal government, you will see <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>591<span class="bracket">]</span></span> it yield. Experience has proven until now that when a state stubbornly wanted something and demanded it resolutely, the state never failed to obtain it; and that when it clearly refused to act,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1312" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1312_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">53</a> it was left free to do so.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3285">If the government of the Union had a force of its own, the physical situation of the country would make the use of it very difficult.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1313" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1313_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">54</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3286">The United States covers an immense territory; long distances separate the states; the population is spread over a country still half wilderness. If the Union undertook by arms to hold the confederated states to their duty, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>592<span class="bracket">]</span></span> its position would be analogous to that of England at the time of the War of Independence.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3287">Moreover, a government, were it strong, could only with difficulty escape the consequences of a principle, once it accepted that principle itself as the foundation of the public law that is to govern it. The confederation has been formed by the free will of the states; the latter by uniting did not lose their nationality and did not merge into one and the same people. If today one of these very states wanted to withdraw its name from the contract, it would be quite difficult to prove that it could not do so. The federal government, in order to combat it, would not rely in a clear way on either force or law.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3288">For the federal government to triumph easily over the resistance that a few of its subjects might put up, it would be necessary for the particular interest of one or of several of them to be intimately linked to the existence of the Union, as has often been seen in the history of confederations.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3289">I suppose that, among these states that the federal bond gathers together, there are some that alone enjoy the principal advantages of union, or whose prosperity depends entirely on the fact of union; it is clear that the central power will find in them a very great support for maintaining the others in obedience. But then it will no longer draw its strength from itself, it will draw it from a principle that is contrary to its nature. Peoples confederate only to gain equal advantages from union, and in the case cited above the federal government is strong because inequality reigns among the united nations.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3290">I suppose again that one of the confederated states has gained a preponderance great enough to take hold of the central power by itself alone; it will consider the other states as its subjects and, in the alleged sovereignty of the Union, will make its own sovereignty respected. Then great things will be done in the name of the federal government, but truly speaking this government will no longer exist.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1314" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1314_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">55</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3291">In these two cases the power that acts in the name of the confederation <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>593<span class="bracket">]</span></span> becomes that much stronger the more you move away from the natural state and the acknowledged principle of confederations.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3292">In America the present union is useful to all the states, but it is essential to none. If several states broke the federal bond, the fate of the others would not be compromised, even though the sum of their happiness would be less. Just as there is no state whose existence or prosperity is entirely<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1315" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1315_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a> linked to the present union, neither is there one that is disposed to make very great personal sacrifices to preserve it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3293">From another perspective, no state is seen for now to have, out of ambition, a great interest in maintaining the confederation as we see it today. All undoubtedly do not exercise the same influence in federal councils, but there is not one of them that should flatter itself about dominating them and that can treat the other confederated states as inferiors or subjects.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3294">So it seems to me certain that if one portion of the Union wanted seriously to separate from the other, not only would you not be able to prevent it from doing so, but you would not even be tempted to try. So the present Union will last only as long as all the states that compose it continue to want to be part of it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3295">This point settled, we are now more at ease: it is no longer a matter of trying to find out if the states currently confederated will be able to separate, but if they will want to remain united.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3296">Among all the reasons that make the present union useful to the Americans, you find two principal ones whose evidence easily strikes everyone.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3297">Although the Americans are so to speak alone on their continent, commerce gives them as neighbors all the peoples with whom they traffic. So despite their apparent isolation, the Americans need to be strong, and they can only be strong by remaining united.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3298">The states by dividing would not only diminish their strength vis-à-vis foreigners, they would create foreigners on their own soil. From that moment they would enter into a system of internal customs; they would divide valleys by imaginary lines; they would imprison the course of rivers and <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>594<span class="bracket">]</span></span> hinder in all ways the exploitation of the immense continent that God granted them as their domain.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3299">Today they have no invasion to fear, consequently no army to maintain, no taxes to levy [no military despotism to fear]; if the Union came to break apart, the need for all these things would perhaps not take long to make itself felt.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3300">So the Americans have an immense interest in remaining united.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3301">From another perspective it is nearly impossible to discover what type of material interest one portion of the Union would have, for now, to separate from the others.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3302">When you cast your eyes over a map of the United States and you see the chain of the Allegheny Mountains running from the Northeast to the Southwest and covering the country over an expanse of 400 leagues, you are tempted to believe that the purpose of Providence was to raise between the Mississippi basin and the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean one of those natural barriers that, opposing the permanent relationships of men with each other, form like necessary limits to different peoples.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3303">But the average height of the Allegheny Mountains does not surpass 800 meters.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1316" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1316_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">56</a> Their rounded summits and the spacious valleys that they enclose within their contours present easy access in a thousand places. There is more. The principal rivers that come to empty their waters into the Atlantic Ocean, the Hudson, the Susquehanna, the Potomac, have their sources beyond the Allegheny Mountains on the open plateau that borders the Mississippi basin. Leaving this region<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1317" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1317_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">57</a> they come out through the rampart that seemed as though it should throw them back toward the west and, once within the mountains, trace natural routes always open to men.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3304">So no barrier is raised between the different parts of the country occupied today by the Anglo-Americans. The Allegheny Mountains are far from serving as limits to peoples; they do not even mark the boundaries of states. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>595<span class="bracket">]</span></span> New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia enclose them within their precincts and extend as far to the west as to the east of these mountains.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1318" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1318_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">58</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3305">The territory occupied today by the twenty-four states of the Union and the three great districts that are not yet placed among the number of states, although they already have inhabitants, covers an area of 131,144 square leagues,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1319" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1319_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">59</a> that is to say that it already presents a surface almost equal to five times that of France.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1320" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1320_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> In these limits are found a varied soil, different temperatures, and very diverse products.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3306">This great expanse of territory occupied by the Anglo-American republics has given birth to doubts about the maintenance of their union. Here distinctions must be made: conflicting interests are sometimes created in the different provinces of a vast empire and end up coming into conflict; then it happens that the great size of the State is what most compromises its duration. But if the men who cover this vast territory do not have conflicting interests among themselves, its very expanse must be useful to their prosperity, for the unity of government singularly favors the exchange that can be made with the different products of the soil, and by making their flow easier, it increases their value.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3307">Now, I clearly see different interests in the different parts of the Union, but I do not find any that conflict with each other.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3308">The states of the South are nearly exclusively agricultural; the states of the North are particularly manufacturing and commercial; the states of the West are at the same time manufacturing and agricultural. In the South tobacco, rice, cotton and sugar are harvested; in the North and in the West, corn and wheat. These are the diverse sources of wealth. But in order to draw upon these sources, there is a means common and equally favorable to all; it is the Union.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1321" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1321_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>596<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3309">The North, which carries the riches of the Anglo-Americans to all parts of the world and the riches of the world into the Union, has a clear interest in having the confederation continue to exist as it is today, so that the number of American producers and consumers that it is called to serve remains the greatest possible. The North is the most natural middleman between the south and the west of the Union, on the one hand, and the rest of the world, on the other; so the North should want the South and the West to remain united and prosperous so that they provide raw materials for its manufacturing and cargo for its ships.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3310">The South and the West have on their side a still more direct interest in the preservation of the Union and the prosperity of the North. The products of the South are in large part exported overseas; so the South and the West need the commercial resources of the North. They should want the Union to have a great maritime power in order to be able to protect them effectively. The South and the West should contribute willingly to the costs of a navy, although they do not have ships; for if the fleets of Europe came to blockade the ports of the South and the Mississippi delta, what would become of the rice of the Carolinas, the tobacco of Virginia, the sugar and cotton that grow in the valleys of the Mississippi? So there is not a portion of the federal budget that does not apply to the preservation of a material interest common to all the confederated states.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3311">[To clarify this subject even more I want to make a comparison drawn from France.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3312">Provence gathers oil and Flanders harvests wheat; Burgundy produces wine and Normandy raises livestock. Do these different provinces find in the diversity of products reasons to hate each other? Isn’t [it (ed.)] on the contrary the diversity of these products that gives them a common interest in remaining united in order to exchange them more freely?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3313">Georgia seems to me to have the same reasons to remain united with Massachusetts as Provence with Flanders, and Ohio appears to me as naturally linked to the state of New York as Burgundy to Normandy.]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1322" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1322_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">x</a></p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3314">Apart from this commercial utility, the South and the West of the Union find a great political advantage in remaining united with each other and with the North.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3315">The South encloses in its bosom an immense population of slaves, a population threatening at present, still more threatening in the future.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3316">The states of the West occupy the bottom of a single valley. The rivers that water the territory of these states, originating from the Rocky or the Allegheny Mountains, all come to mingle their waters with that of the Mississippi and flow with it toward the Gulf of Mexico. The states of the West are entirely isolated by their position from the traditions of Europe and the civilization of the Old World.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3317">So the inhabitants of the South should desire to preserve the Union in order not to live alone in the face of the Blacks, and the inhabitants of the West, in order not to find themselves enclosed within the central part of America without free communication with the world.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3318">The North for its part should want the Union not to divide, in order to remain as the link that joins this great body to the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3319">So there exists a tight bond among the material interests of all parts of the Union.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3320">I will say as much for the opinions and the sentiments that you could call the non-material interests of man.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3321">The inhabitants of the United States speak a great deal about their love <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>598<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of country; I admit that I do not trust this considered patriotism that is based upon interest and that interest, by changing object, can destroy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3322">Nor do I attach a very great importance to the language of the Americans, when each day they express the intention of preserving the federal system that their fathers adopted.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3323">What maintains a large number of citizens under the same government is much less the reasoned will to remain united than the instinctive and in a way involuntary accord that results from similarity of sentiments and resemblance of opinions.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3324">I will never admit that men form a society by the sole fact that they acknowledge the same leader and obey the same laws; there is a society only when men consider a great number of objects in the same way; when they have the same opinions on a great number of subjects; when, finally, the same facts give rise among them to the same impressions and the same thoughts.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1324" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1324_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">y</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3325">Whoever, considering the question from this point of view, would study what is happening to the United States, would discover without difficulty that their inhabitants, divided as they are into twenty-four distinct sovereignties, constitute nonetheless a single people; and perhaps he would even come to think that the state of society more truly exists within the Anglo-American Union than among certain nations of Europe that have nevertheless only a single legislation and are subject to one man alone.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1325" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1325_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">z</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>599<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3326">Although the Anglo-Americans have several religions, they all have the same way of envisaging religion.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1326" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1326_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3327">They do not always agree on the means to take in order to govern well and vary on some of the forms that are appropriate to give to the government, but they agree on the general principles that should govern human societies. From Maine to Florida, from the Missouri to the Atlantic Ocean, they believe that the origin of all legitimate powers is in the people. They conceive the same ideas on liberty and on equality; they profess the same opinions on the press, the right of association, the jury, the responsibility of the agents of power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3328">If we pass from political and religious ideas to the philosophical and moral opinions that regulate the daily actions of life and guide conduct as a whole, we will note the same agreement.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>600<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3329">The Anglo-Americans<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1327" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1327_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">60</a> place moral authority in universal reason, as they do political power in the universality of citizens, and they consider that you must rely on the sense of all in order to discern what is permitted or forbidden, what is true or false. Most of them think that knowledge of his interest well understood is sufficient to lead a man toward the just and the honest. They believe that each person by birth has received the ability to govern himself, and that no one has the right to force his fellow to be happy. All have an intense faith in human perfectibility; they judge that the diffusion of knowledge must necessarily produce useful results, ignorance must lead to harmful effects; all consider society as a body in progress; humanity as a changing scene, where nothing is or should be fixed forever, and they admit that what seems good to them today can be replaced tomorrow by something better that is still hidden.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1328" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1328_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3330">I do not say that all these opinions are correct, but they are American. At the same time that the Anglo-Americans are thus united with each other by these shared ideas, they are separated from all other peoples by a sentiment, pride.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3331">For fifty years it has not ceased to be repeated to the inhabitants of the United States that they form the only religious, enlightened and free people. They see that among them until now democratic institutions have prospered, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>601<span class="bracket">]</span></span> while they fail in the rest of the world; so they have an immense opinion of themselves, and they are not far from believing that they form a species apart in the human race.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3332">Thus the dangers that menace the American Union do not arise from diversity of opinions any more than from that of interests. They must be sought in the variety of characters and in the passions of the Americans.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3333">The men who inhabit the immense territory of the United States have nearly all come from a shared stock; but over time climate and above all slavery have introduced marked differences between the character of the English of the South and the character of the English of the North.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3334">It is generally believed among us that slavery gives to one portion of the Union interests contrary to those of the others. I have not noted that this was the case. Slavery has not created interests in the South contrary to those of the North; but it has modified the character of the inhabitants of the South, and has given them different habits.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3335">I have shown elsewhere what influence servitude had exercised on the commercial capacity of the Americans of the South; this same influence extends equally to their mores.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3336">The slave is a servant who does not argue and who submits to everything without a murmur. Sometimes he murders his master, but he never resists him. In the South there are no families so poor that they do not have slaves. The American of the South from his birth finds himself invested with a kind of domestic dictatorship; the first notions that he receives of life make him know that he is born to command, and the first habit that he contracts is that of dominating without difficulty. So education tends powerfully to make the American of the South a man haughty, quick, irascible, violent, ardent in his desires, impatient with obstacles; but easy to discourage if he cannot triumph with the first blow.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3337">The American of the North does not see slaves rush up around his cradle. He does not even find free servants, for most often he is limited to providing for his needs by himself. Soon after he is born, his mind is presented with the idea of necessity from all directions. So he learns early to know on his own the exact natural limit of his power; he does not expect to bend by force wills that are opposed to his, and he knows that to gain the support <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>602<span class="bracket">]</span></span> of his fellows it is above all necessary to win their favor. So he is patient, thoughtful, tolerant,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1329" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1329_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a> slow to act, and persevering in his designs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3338">In the southern states the most pressing needs of man are always satisfied. Thus the American of the South is not preoccupied by the material needs of life; someone else takes care of thinking about them for him. Free on this point, his imagination is directed toward other greater and less precisely defined matters. [&lt;So the whites in the south form an aristocratic body {kind of aristocracy}. Consequently a certain feudal tendency reigns in their thoughts and in their tastes.&gt;] The American of the South loves grandeur, luxury, glory, fame, pleasures, idleness above all; nothing forces him to make efforts in order to live, and as he has no necessary work, he falls asleep and does not undertake even useful work.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3339">Because equality of fortunes reigns in the North, and slavery no longer exists there, man there is absorbed, as it were, by these very material concerns that the white scorns in the South. From his birth he is busy fighting poverty, and he learns to place material comfort above all the enjoyments of the mind and heart. His imagination, concentrated on the small details of life, fades, his ideas are fewer and less general, but they become more practical, clearer and more precise. Since he directs all the efforts of his intelligence only toward the study of well-being, he does not take long to excel there; he knows admirably how to make the most of nature and of men in order to produce wealth; he understands marvelously the art of making society work toward the prosperity of each one of its members, and of extracting from individual egoism the happiness of all.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3340">The man of the North has not only experience, but also learning; but he does not prize knowledge as a pleasure. He values it as a means, and he avidly takes hold only of its useful applications.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3341">The American [{man}] of the South is more spontaneous, more witty, more open, more generous, more intellectual and more brilliant.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3342">The American [{man}] of the North is more active, more reasonable, more enlightened and more skillful.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>603<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3343">The one has the tastes, prejudices, weaknesses and the grandeur of all aristocracies.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3344">The other, the qualities and failings that characterize the middle class.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3345">Bring two men together in society, give to these two men the same interests and in part the same opinions; if their character, their enlightenment and their civilization differ, there is a great chance that they will not get along. The same remark is applicable to a society of nations.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1330" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1330_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3346">So slavery does not attack the American confederation directly by interests, but indirectly by mores.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3347">The states that joined the federal pact in 1790 numbered thirteen; the confederation counts twenty-four of them today. The population that amounted to nearly four million in 1790 had quadrupled in the space of forty years; in 1830 it rose to nearly thirteen million.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1331" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1331_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">61</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3348">Such changes cannot take place without danger.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3349">For a society of nations as for a society of individuals, there are three principal ways to last: the wisdom of the members, their individual weakness, and their small number.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3350">The Americans who withdraw from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean in order to plunge into the West are adventurers impatient with any kind of yoke, greedy for wealth, often cast out by the states where they were born. They arrive in the middle of the wilderness without knowing each other. There they find to control them neither traditions nor family support, nor examples. Among them the rule of laws is weak, and that of mores is weaker still. So the men who daily populate the valleys of the Mississippi are inferior in all ways to the Americans who inhabit the old limits of the Union. They already exercise, however, a great influence in its councils, and they <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>604<span class="bracket">]</span></span> arrive at the government of common affairs before having learned to manage themselves.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1332" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1332_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">62</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3351">The weaker the members are individually, the greater the society’s chances to last, for they then have security only by remaining united. When, in 1790, the most populated of the American republics did not have 500,000 inhabitants,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1333" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1333_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">63</a> each one of them felt its insignificance as an independent people, and this thought made obedience to a federal authority easier. But when one of the confederated states numbers 2,000,000 inhabitants, as does the state of New York, and covers a territory whose area is equal to one-quarter of that of France,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1334" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1334_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">64</a> it feels strong by itself, and if it continues to desire the union as useful to its well-being, it no longer regards it as necessary to its existence; it can do without it; and agreeing to remain there, it does not take long to want to be preponderant in it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3352">The mere multiplication of members of the Union would already tend powerfully to break the federal bond. All men placed at the same point of view do not look at the same objects in the same way. This is so with all the more reason when the point of view is different. So as the number of American republics increases, you see the chance to gather the assent of all to the same laws diminish.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3353">Today the interests of the different parts of the Union are not in conflict with each other; but who could foresee the various changes that the near future will bring about in a country where each day creates cities and every five years nations?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3354">Since the founding of the English colonies the number of inhabitants doubles every twenty-two years or so; I do not see any causes that should for the next century stop this progressive movement of the Anglo-American population. Before one hundred years have passed I think that the territory <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>605<span class="bracket">]</span></span> occupied or claimed by the United States will be covered by more than one hundred million inhabitants and divided into forty states.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1335" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1335_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">65</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3355">I admit that these one hundred million men do not have different interests; I grant them all, on the contrary, an equal advantage in remaining united, and I say that, by the very fact that they are one hundred million, forming forty distinct and unequally powerful nations, the maintenance of the federal government is nothing more than a happy accident.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3356">I would like to believe in human perfectibility; but until men have changed in nature and are completely transformed, I will refuse to believe in the duration of a government whose task is to hold together forty diverse peoples spread over a surface equal to half of Europe,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1336" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1336_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">66</a> to avoid rivalries, ambition, and struggles among them, and to bring the action of their independent wills together toward the accomplishment of the same projects.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3357">But the greatest risk that the Union runs by growing comes from the continual displacement of forces that takes place within it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3358">From the shores of Lake Superior to the Gulf of Mexico, you count as the crow flies about four hundred French leagues. Along this immense line winds the frontier of the United States; sometimes it stays within these limits, most often it penetrates well beyond into the wilderness. It has been calculated that along this entire vast front whites advanced each year on average seven leagues.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1337" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1337_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">67</a> From time to time an obstacle presents itself: it is an unproductive district, a lake, an Indian nation that is met unexpectedly <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>606<span class="bracket">]</span></span> in its path. The column then stops an instant; its two extremities bend toward each other and, after they have rejoined, the advance begins again. There is in this gradual and continuous march of the European race towards the Rocky Mountains something providential; it is like a flood of men that rises unceasingly and that swells each day by the hand of God.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3359">Within this first line of conquerors cities are built and vast states are founded. In 1790, scarcely a few thousand pioneers were found spread across the valleys of the Mississippi; today these same valleys hold as many men as the entire nation contained in 1790. The population there reaches nearly four million inhabitants.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1338" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1338_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">68</a> The city of Washington was founded in 1800, at the very center of the American confederation; now this city finds itself at one of its extremities. The representatives of the last states of the West,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1339" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1339_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">69</a> in order to take their seats in Congress, are already obliged to make a journey as long as that of the traveler who goes from Vienna to Paris.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3360">All the states of the Union are carried along at the same time towards wealth; but all cannot grow and prosper in the same proportion.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3361">In the north of the Union detached branches of the Allegheny Mountain chain, advancing to the Atlantic Ocean, form spacious harbors and ports always open to the largest ships. From the Potomac, in contrast, and following the coast of America to the mouth of the Mississippi, you find nothing more than a flat and sandy terrain. In this part of the Union the mouths of nearly all the rivers are obstructed, and the ports that are open here and there in the middle of lagoons do not present to ships the same depth and offer to commerce much smaller facilities than those of the North.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3362">To this first inferiority which arises from nature another is joined that comes from laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3363">We have seen that slavery, which is abolished in the North, still exists in the South, and I have shown the fatal influence that it exercises on the well-being of the master himself.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>607<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3364">So the North must be more commercial<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1340" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1340_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">70</a> and more industrious than the South. It is natural that population and wealth concentrate there more rapidly.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3365">The states situated on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean are already half populated. Most of the lands have an owner; so those states cannot receive the same number of emigrants as the states of the West that still offer an unlimited field to industry. The basin of the Mississippi is infinitely more fertile than the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. This reason added to all the others vigorously pushes the Europeans toward the West. This is rigorously demonstrated by figures.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3366">If you work with the whole of the United States, you find that in forty years the number of inhabitants there has more or less tripled. But if you envisage only the basin of the Mississippi, you discover that in the same period of time the population<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1341" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1341_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">71</a> there has become thirty-one times greater.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1342" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1342_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">72</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3367">Each day the center of federal power is displaced. Forty years ago the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>608<span class="bracket">]</span></span> majority of the citizens of the Union were on the shores of the sea in the vicinity of the place where Washington is rising today; now it is deeper into the land and more to the North; you can be sure that within twenty years it will be on the other side of the Allegheny Mountains. Assuming that the Union continues to exist, the basin of the Mississippi, because of its fertility and its extent, is necessarily called to become the permanent center of federal power. In thirty or forty years the basin of the Mississippi will have taken its natural rank. It is easy to calculate that then its population, compared to that of the states placed on the shores of the Atlantic, will be in proportion of about 40 to 11. So in a few more years the leadership of the Union will escape completely from the states that formed it, and the population of the valleys of the Mississippi will predominate in federal councils.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3368">This continuous gravitation of strength and federal influence toward the Northwest is revealed every ten years, when, after doing a federal census of the population, the number of representatives that each state must send to Congress is fixed once again.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1343" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1343_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">73</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3369">In 1790, Virginia had nineteen representatives in Congress. This number continued to grow until 1813, when we saw it attain the figure of twenty-three. From this time it began to decrease. In 1833 it was no more than twenty-one.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1345" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1345_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">74</a> During this same period the state of New York followed an <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>609<span class="bracket">]</span></span> opposite progression: in 1790, it had in Congress ten representatives; in 1813, twenty-seven; in 1823, thirty-four; in 1833, forty. Ohio did not have a single representative in 1803; in 1833 it had nineteen.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3370">It is difficult to conceive of a lasting union between two peoples one of whom is poor and weak, the other rich and strong, even if it would be proved that the strength and wealth of one is not the cause of the weakness and poverty of the other. Union is still more difficult to maintain in a time when one is losing strength and when the other is in the process of gaining it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3371">This rapid and disproportionate increase of certain states threatens the independence of the others. If New York, with its two million inhabitants and its forty representatives, wanted to pass a law in Congress, it would perhaps succeed. But even if the most powerful states did not seek to oppress the least powerful, the danger would still exist, for it is in the possibility of the deed almost as much as in the deed itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3372">The weak rarely have confidence in the justice and reason of the strong. So the states that are growing less quickly than the others cast a look of distrust and envy on those that fortune favors. From that comes this profound malaise and this vague uneasiness that you notice in one part of the Union, and that contrast with the well-being and confidence that reign in the other. I think that the hostile attitude taken by the South has no other causes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3373">The men of the South are of all Americans those who should most hold on to the Union, for they are the ones who above all would suffer from being abandoned to themselves; but they are the only ones who threaten to break the bond of the confederation. What causes that? It is easy to say: the South, which provided four Presidents to the confederation;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1346" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1346_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">75</a> which knows today that federal power is escaping from it; which each year sees <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>610<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the number of its representatives to Congress decrease and those of the North and of the West increase; the South, populated by ardent and irascible men, is getting angry and is becoming uneasy. It looks at itself with distress; examining the past, it wonders each day if it is not oppressed. If it comes to find that a law of the Union is not clearly favorable to it, it cries out that it is being abused by force; it complains ardently, and if its voice is not heard, it becomes indignant and threatens to withdraw from a society whose costs it bears, without getting any profits.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3374">“The tariff laws,” said the inhabitants of Carolina in 1832, “enrich the North and ruin the South, for, otherwise, how could you imagine that the North, with its inhospitable climate and arid soil, would constantly increase its wealth and power, while the South, which is the garden of America, is falling rapidly into decline?”<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1347" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1347_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">76</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3375">If the changes that I have talked about took place gradually, so that each generation at least had the time to pass by along with the order of things that it had witnessed, the danger would be less; but there is something precipitous, I could almost say revolutionary, in the progress that society makes in America. The same citizen has been able to see his state march at the head of the Union and then become powerless in federal councils. There is one such Anglo-American republic that grew up as quickly as a man, and that was born, grew and reached maturity in thirty years.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3376">It must not be imagined, however, that the states that lose power are becoming depopulated or are declining; their prosperity is not stopping; they are growing even more quickly than any kingdom of Europe.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1348" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1348_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">77</a> But it <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>611<span class="bracket">]</span></span> seems to them that they are becoming poor because they are not becoming rich as quickly as their neighbor, and they believe they are losing their power because they suddenly come in contact with a power greater than theirs.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1350" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1350_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">78</a> So it is their sentiments and their passions that are wounded more than their interests. But isn’t this enough for the confederation to be at risk? If since the beginning of the world peoples and kings had in view only their true utility, you would hardly know what war was among men.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3377">Thus the greatest danger that threatens the United States arises from their very prosperity; it tends to create among several of the confederated states the intoxication that accompanies the rapid augmentation of wealth, and, among others, the envy, distrust and the regrets that most often follow its loss.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3378">The Americans rejoice when contemplating this extraordinary movement; they should, it seems to me, consider it with regret and with fear. Whatever they do, the Americans of the United States will become one of the greatest peoples of the world; they will cover nearly all of North America with their offspring; the continent that they inhabit is their domain, it cannot escape them. So what presses them to take possession of it today? Wealth, power and glory cannot fail to be theirs, and they rush toward this immense fortune as if only a moment remained for them to grasp it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3379">I believe I have demonstrated that the existence of the present confederation depends entirely on the agreement of all the confederated states to want to remain united; and from this given I tried to find out what the causes are that could lead the different states to want to separate. But there are two ways for the Union to perish. One of the confederated states can want to withdraw from the contract and thus break the common bond violently; most of the remarks that I have made before apply to this case. The federal government can progressively lose its power by a simultaneous tendency of the united republics to take back the use of their independence. The central power, deprived successively of all of its prerogatives, reduced <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>612<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by a tacit agreement to powerlessness, would become incapable of fulfilling its object, and the second Union would perish like the first, by a sort of senile weakness.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3380">The gradual weakening of the federal bond, which leads finally to the annulment of the Union, is moreover in itself a distinct fact that can lead to many other less extreme results before producing that final result. The confederation would still exist, though the weakness of its government could already have reduced the nation to powerlessness, and caused internal anarchy and the slowing of the general prosperity of the country.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3381">So after trying to find out what is leading<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1351" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1351_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> the Anglo-Americans to become disunited, it is important to examine whether, given the Union’ scontinued existence, their government is enlarging the sphere of its action or is narrowing it, whether it is becoming more energetic or weaker.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3382">The Americans are clearly preoccupied by a great fear. They notice that among most peoples of the world the exercise of the rights of sovereignty tend to become concentrated in a few hands, and they are afraid of the idea that it will end up by being so among them. The statesmen themselves experience these terrors, or at least pretend to experience them; for in America centralization is not popular, and you cannot more skillfully court the majority than by rising against the alleged encroachments of the central power. The Americans refuse to see that in countries where this centralizing tendency that frightens them manifests itself, you find only a single people, while the Union is a confederation of different peoples; a fact that is sufficient to disrupt all of the expectations based on the analogy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3383">I admit that I consider these fears of a great number<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1352" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1352_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">g</a> of Americans as entirely imaginary. Far from fearing like them the consolidation of sovereignty in the hands of the Union, I believe that the federal government is becoming weaker in a visible way.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3384">To prove what I am advancing on this point I will not resort to old <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>613<span class="bracket">]</span></span> facts, but to those that I was able to witness or that have taken place in our time.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1353" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1353_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3385">When you examine attentively what is happening in the United States, you discover without difficulty the existence of two contrary tendencies; they are like two currents that travel over the same bed in opposite directions.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3386">During the forty-five years that the Union has existed time has dealt with a host of provincial prejudices that at first militated against it. The patriotic sentiment that attached each of the Americans to his state has become less exclusive. By getting to know each other better the various parts of the Union have drawn closer. The mail, that great link between minds, today penetrates into the heart of the wilderness;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1354" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1354_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">79</a> steamboats make all points of the coast communicate with each other daily. Commerce descends and goes back up the rivers of the interior with an unparalleled rapidity.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1355" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1355_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">80</a> To these opportunities created by nature and art are joined instability of desires, restlessness of spirit, and love of riches that, constantly pushing the American out of his house, put him in communication with a great number of his fellow citizens. He travels his country in all directions; he visits all the populations that inhabit it. You do not find a province of France whose inhabitants know each other as perfectly as the 13 million men who cover the surface of the United States.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>614<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3387">At the same time that the Americans mingle, they assimilate; the differences that climate, origin and institutions have placed between them diminish. They all get closer and closer to a common type. Each year thousands of men who have left the North spread throughout all parts of the Union: they bring with them their beliefs, their opinions, their mores, and as their enlightenment is superior to that of the men among whom they are going to live, they do not take long to take hold of affairs and to modify society to their profit. This continual emigration of the North toward the South singularly favors the fusion of all the provincial characters into one single national character.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1356" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1356_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a> So the civilization of the North seems destined to become the common measure against which all the rest must model themselves one day.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1357" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1357_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3388">As the industry of the Americans makes progress, you see the commercial bonds that unite all the confederated states tighten, and the union moves from opinions into habits. The passage of time finally makes a host of fantastic terrors that tormented the imagination of the men of 1789 disappear. The federal power has not become oppressive; it has not destroyed the independence of the states; it does not lead the confederated states to monarchy; with the Union the small states have not fallen into dependence on the large. The confederation has continued to grow constantly in population, in wealth, in power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3389">So I am persuaded that in our times the Americans have fewer natural difficulties living united than they found in 1789; the Union has fewer enemies than then.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1358" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1358_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>615<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3390">And yet, if you want to study carefully the history of the United States over forty-five years, you will easily be persuaded that the federal power is declining.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3391">It is not difficult to point out the causes of this phenomenon.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3392">At the moment when the Constitution of 1789 was promulgated, everything was perishing in anarchy; the Union that followed this disorder excited much fear and hatred; but it had ardent friends because it was the expression of a great need. So although more attacked then than it is today, the federal power rapidly reached its maximum power, as usually happens to a government that triumphs after inflaming its forces in the struggle. In this period the interpretation of the Constitution seemed to expand rather than narrow federal sovereignty, and the Union presented in several respects the spectacle of one and the same people led, within as without, by a single government.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1359" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1359_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3393">But in order to reach this point the people in a way surpassed itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3394">The Constitution had not destroyed the individuality of the states, and all bodies, whatever they may be, have a secret instinct that carries them toward independence. This instinct is still more pronounced in a country like America, where each village forms a kind of republic accustomed to governing itself.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3395">So there was an effort made by the states that submitted to federal preponderance. And every effort, even if crowned with a great success, cannot fail to weaken with the cause that gave it birth.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3396">As the federal government consolidated its power, America resumed its rank among nations, peace reappeared on its borders, public credit recovered; confusion was succeeded by a settled and [well-regulated] order that allowed individual industry to follow its natural path and develop in liberty.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3397">This very prosperity began to make the Americans lose sight of the cause <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>616<span class="bracket">]</span></span> that had produced it; the danger having passed, they no longer found in themselves the energy and patriotism that had helped to avert it. Delivered from the fears that preoccupied them, they lapsed easily into the course of their habits and abandoned themselves without resistance to the ordinary tendency of their inclinations. From the moment when a strong government no longer seemed necessary, some began again to think that it was a nuisance. Everything prospered with the Union, and no one separated from the Union; but they hardly wanted to feel the action of the power that represented it. In general they desired to remain united, and in each particular fact they tended to become independent again. The principle of confederation was each day more easily accepted and less applied; thus the federal government itself, by creating order and peace, brought about its decline.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3398">As soon as this disposition of minds began to show itself outwardly, party men who live on the passions of the people began to exploit it to their profit.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3399">From that moment the federal government found itself in a very critical situation; its enemies had popular favor, and by promising to weaken it, they gained the right to lead it.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1360" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1360_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3400">From that period onward every time the government of the Union entered into a contest with that of the states, it has almost never ceased to retreat. When there has been an occasion to interpret the terms of the federal Constitution, the interpretation has most often been against the Union and favorable to the states.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3401">The Constitution gave the federal government the care of providing for the national interests. It had been thought that it was up to the federal government to do or to encourage in the interior the great undertakings (<span class="ital">internal improvements</span>) that were of a nature to increase the prosperity of the entire Union, such as, for example, canals.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3402">The states became frightened by the idea of seeing an authority other than their own thus dispose of a portion of their territory. They feared that the central power, acquiring a formidable patronage in this way within their <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>617<span class="bracket">]</span></span> own area, would come to exercise an influence there that they wanted to reserve entirely to their agents alone.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1361" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1361_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">p</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3403">The democratic party that was always opposed to all developments of the federal power then raised its voice; Congress was accused of usurpation; the head of State, of ambition. The central government intimidated by this uproar ended by recognizing its error itself, and by with drawing strictly into the sphere that was drawn for it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3404">The Constitution gives the Union the privilege of dealing with foreign peoples. The Union had in general considered the Indian tribes that border the frontiers of its territory from this point of view. As long as these savages agreed to flee before civilization, the federal right was not contested; but from the day when an Indian tribe undertook to settle on a piece of land, the surrounding states claimed a right of possession over these lands and a right of sovereignty over the men within them. The central government hastened to recognize both, and after dealing with the Indians as with independent peoples, it delivered them as subjects to the legislative tyranny of the states.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1362" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1362_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">81</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3405">Among the states that were formed along the Atlantic shore, several extended indefinitely to the West into the wilderness where Europeans had not yet penetrated. Those whose limits were irrevocably fixed jealously saw the immense future open to their neighbors. The former, in a spirit of conciliation and in order to facilitate the act of Union, agreed to draw limits for themselves and abandoned to the confederation all the territory that could be found beyond those limits.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1363" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1363_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">82</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3406">Since this period the federal government has become the proprietor of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>618<span class="bracket">]</span></span> all the unsettled land<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1364" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1364_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">TN6</a> found outside of the thirteen states originally confederated. It is the federal government that undertakes to divide and to sell that land, and the money that is brought in is put exclusively into the treasury of the Union. With the aid of this revenue the federal government buys the Indians’ lands from them, opens roads in new districts, and facilitates with all its power the rapid development of society there.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3407">Now, it has happened that in these very wilderness areas, formerly ceded by the inhabitants on the shores of the Atlantic, new states have formed over time. Congress has continued to sell, to the profit of the entire nation, the unsettled lands that these states still enclose within them. But today those states claim that once constituted they should have the exclusive right to apply the proceeds of these sales to their own use. Since complaints had become more and more threatening, Congress believed it necessary to take away from the Union a part of the privileges that it had enjoyed until then, and at the end of 1832, it passed a law that, without ceding to the new republics of the West the ownership of their unsettled lands, nonetheless applied the greatest part of the revenue that was drawn from it to their profit alone.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1365" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1365_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">83</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3408">It is sufficient to travel across the United States to appreciate the advantages that the country derives from the bank.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1367" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1367_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">r</a> These advantages are of several kinds; but there is one above all that strikes the foreigner; the notes of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>619<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the Bank of the United States are accepted at the same value on the wilderness frontier as in Philadelphia, the seat of its operations.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1368" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1368_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">84</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3409">The Bank of the United States, however, is the object of great hatred. Its directors have declared themselves against the President, and they are accused not improbably of having abused their influence in order to hinder his election. So the President, with all the fervor of a personal enmity, attacks the institution that the former represent. What has encouraged the President to pursue his vengeance in this way is that he feels supported by the secret instincts of the majority.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3410">The Bank forms the great monetary link of the Union as the Congress is its great legislative link, and the same passions that tend to make the states independent of the central power tend toward the destruction of the Bank.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3411">The Bank of the United States always holds in its hands a great number of the notes belonging to the provincial banks; every day it can oblige the latter to redeem their notes in specie. For the Bank, in contrast, such a danger is not to be feared; the greatness of its available resources allows it to meet all expenses. Their existence thus threatened, the provincial banks are forced to exercise restraint and to put into circulation only a number of notes proportionate to their capital. Only with impatience do the provincial banks endure this salutary control. So the newspapers that are their creatures and the President, made by his interest into their organ, attack the Bank with a kind of fury. Against it they stir up local passions and the blind democratic instinct of the country. According to them the directors of the Bank form an aristocratic and permanent body whose influence cannot fail to make itself felt in the government, and must sooner or later alter the principles of equality on which American society rests.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3412">The struggle of the Bank against its enemies is only one incident in the great battle that the provinces wage in America against the central power; <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>620<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the spirit of independence and democracy, against the spirit of hierarchy and subordination. I am not claiming that the enemies of the Bank of the United States are precisely the same individuals who on other points attack the federal government; but I am saying that the attacks against the Bank of the United States are the result of the same instincts that militate against the federal government, and that the large number of the enemies of the first is an unfortunate symptom of the weakening of the second.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3413">But the Union<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1369" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1369_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">s</a> has never shown itself more feeble than in the famous tariff affair.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1370" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1370_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">85</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3414">The wars of the French Revolution and that of 1812, by preventing free communication between America and Europe, had created factories in the north of the Union. When peace had reopened the road to the New World to European products, the Americans believed they had to establish a system of tariffs that could at the very same time protect their emerging industry and pay off the amount of debts that the wars had made them contract.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3415">The states of the South,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1371" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1371_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">t</a> which have no manufacturing to encourage and which are only agricultural, did not take long to complain about this measure.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3416">I am not claiming to examine here what could be imaginary or real in their complaints, I am telling the facts.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3417">From 1820 onward, South Carolina declared in a petition to Congress that the tariff law was <span class="ital">unconstitutional, oppressive</span> and <span class="ital">unjust.</span> After that Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, the state of Alabama and that of Mississippi, made more or less energetic complaints along the same lines.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>621<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3418">Far from taking these murmurings into account, Congress, in the years 1824 and 1828, again raised the tariff duties and again sanctioned the principle.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3419">Then was produced or rather was recalled in the South a celebrated doctrine that took the name of <span class="ital">nullification.</span><a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1372" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1372_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">u</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3420">I have shown in its place that the purpose of the federal Constitution was not to establish a league, but to create a national government. The Americans of the United States, in all cases foreseen by their Constitution, form only one and the same people. On all those points the national will expresses itself, as among all constitutional peoples, with the aid of a majority. Once the majority has spoken, the duty of the minority is to submit.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3421">Such is the legal doctrine, the only one that is in agreement with the text of the Constitution and the known intention of those who established it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3422">The <span class="ital">nullifiers</span> of the South claim on the contrary that the Americans, by uniting, did not intend to blend into one and the same people, but that they only wanted to form a league of independent peoples; it follows that each state, having preserved its complete sovereignty if not in action at least in principle, has the right to interpret the laws of Congress, and to suspend within its borders the execution of those that to it seem opposed to the Constitution or to justice.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3423">The entire doctrine of nullification is found in summary in a sentence pronounced in 1833 before the Senate of the United States by Mr. Calhoun, avowed head of the nullifiers of the South:</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3424">“The Constitution is a compact, to which the states are parties in their sovereign capacity; and that, as in all other cases of compact between parties having no common umpire, each has a right to judge for itself [the extent of its reserved powers].”<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1373" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1373_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">v</a></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>622<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3425">It is clear that such a doctrine destroys the federal bond in principle and in fact brings back the anarchy from which the Constitution of 1789 had delivered the Americans.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3426">When South Carolina saw that Congress showed itself deaf to its complaints, it threatened to apply to the federal tariff law the doctrine of the nullifiers. Congress persisted in its system; finally the storm broke.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3427">In the course of 1832, the people of South Carolina<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1374" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1374_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">86</a> called a national [state] convention to decide on the extraordinary means that remained to be taken; and on November 24 of the same year this convention published, under the name of an ordinance, a law that nullified the federal tariff law, and forbade levying the duties that were set forth there, and forbade accepting appeals that could be made to the federal courts.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1375" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1375_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">87</a> This ordinance was supposed to be put in force only in the following month of February, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>623<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and it was pointed out that if Congress modified the tariff before this time, South Carolina would agree not to follow up on its threats with other measures. Later, but in a vague and unspecified way, the desire to submit the question to an extraordinary assembly of all the confederated states was expressed.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3428">While waiting, South Carolina armed its militia and prepared for war.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3429">What did Congress do? Congress, which had not listened to its entreating subjects, lent its ear to their complaints as soon as it saw them with weapons in hand.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1376" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1376_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">88</a> It passed a law<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1377" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1377_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">89</a> according to which the duties set in the tariff were to be progressively reduced over ten years, until they had reached the point of not exceeding the needs of the government. Thus Congress completely abandoned the tariff principle. For a duty that protected industry, Congress substituted a purely fiscal measure.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1378" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1378_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">90</a> In order to hide its defeat, the government of the Union took recourse in an expedient that is much used by weak governments: while yielding on the facts, it showed itself inflexible on the principles. At the same time that Congress changed the tariff legislation, it passed another law by virtue of which the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>624<span class="bracket">]</span></span> President was vested with an extraordinary power to overcome by force the resistance that then was no longer to be feared.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3430">South Carolina did not even agree to leave to the Union these weak appearances of victory; the same national [state] convention that had nullified the tariff law, having assembled again, accepted the concession that had been offered to it; but at the same time it declared that it would only persist more forcefully in the doctrine of the nullifiers, and to prove it, it annulled the law that conferred extraordinary powers on the President, even though it was very certain that no use would be made of it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3431">Nearly all the actions that I have just spoken about took place during the Presidency of General Jackson. You cannot deny that in the tariff affair the latter upheld the rights of the Union with skill and vigor. I believe, however, that, among the number of dangers that the federal power runs today, you must include the very conduct of the one who represents it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3432">Some persons in Europe have formed an opinion concerning the influence that General Jackson can exercise in the affairs of his country that seems very extravagant to those who have seen things up close.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3433">You have heard it said that General Jackson had won battles, that he was an energetic man, led by character and habit to the use of force, avid for power and a despot by taste. All that is perhaps true, but the consequences that have been drawn from these truths are great mistakes.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3434">It has been imagined that General Jackson wanted to establish a dictatorship in the United States, that he was going to make the military spirit reign there, and extend the central power to the point of endangering provincial liberties. In America the time for such undertakings and the century of such men has not yet arrived. If General Jackson had wanted to dominate in this way, he would assuredly have lost his political position and compromised his life; so he has not been so imprudent as to attempt it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3435">Far from wanting to extend federal power, the current President represents, on the contrary, the party that wants to restrict this power to the clearest and most precise terms of the Constitution, and that does not accept any interpretation that can ever be favorable to the government of the Union; far from presenting himself as the champion of centralization, General Jackson is the agent of provincial jealousies; it is the <span class="ital">decentralizing</span> <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>625<span class="bracket">]</span></span> passions (if I can express myself in this way) that brought him to sovereign power. He remains and prospers there by flattering these passions each day. General Jackson is the slave of the majority; he follows it in its will, in its desires, in its half-discovered instincts, or rather he divines it and runs to put himself at its head.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3436">Each time that the government of the states struggles with that of the Union it is rare that the President is not the first to doubt his right; he is almost always ahead of the legislative power; when there is room for interpretation on the extent of federal power, he lines up in a way against himself; he belittles himself, he hides, he stands aside.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1379" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1379_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> It is not that he is naturally weak or an enemy of the union; when the majority declared itself against the pretensions of the nullifiers of the South, you saw him put himself at its head, formulate with clarity and energy the doctrine that the majority professed and be the first to call for the use of force. General Jackson, to use a comparison borrowed from the vocabulary of American parties, seems to me <span class="ital">federal</span> by taste and <span class="ital">republican</span> by calculation.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1380" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1380_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">w</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3437">After thus demeaning himself before the majority in order to win its favor, General Jackson rises again; he then marches toward the objects that the majority itself pursues, or toward those that it does not see with jealousy, overturning every obstacle before him. Strong due to a support that his predecessors did not have, he tramples underfoot his personal enemies wherever he finds them, with an ease that no President has found; on his own responsibility he takes measures that none before him would ever have dared to take; it even happens that he treats the national representation with a sort of almost insulting disdain; he refuses to approve the laws passed by Congress, and often neglects to respond to this great body. He is like a favorite who sometimes treats his master rudely. So the power of General Jackson is constantly increasing; but that of the President is decreasing. In <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>626<span class="bracket">]</span></span> his hands the federal government is strong; it will pass enervated to his successor.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3438">Either I am strangely mistaken, or the federal government tends each day to become weaker; it is withdrawing successively from affairs, it is narrowing more and more the circle of its action. Naturally weak, it is abandoning even the appearance of strength. From another perspective I thought I saw in the United States that the sentiment of independence was becoming more and more intense in the states, the love of provincial government more and more pronounced.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3439">The Union is desired; but reduced to a shadow. They want it strong in certain cases and weak in all the others; they pretend that in time of war it can gather in its hand the national forces and all the resources of the country, and that in time of peace it does not so to speak exist; as if this alternation between debility and vigor was natural.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3440">I see nothing that can for now stop this general movement of minds; the causes that have given it birth do not cease to operate in the same direction. So it will continue, and it can be predicted that, unless some extraordinary circumstance arises, the government of the Union will grow weaker each day.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3441">I believe however that we are still far from the time when the federal power, incapable of protecting its own existence and bringing peace to the country, will fade away in a sense by itself. The Union is in the mores, it is desired; its results are clear, its benefits visible. When it is noticed that the weakness of the federal government compromises the existence of the Union, I do not doubt that we will see the birth of a movement of reaction in favor of strength.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3442">The government of the United States is, of all the federal governments that have been established until now, the one that is most naturally destined to act; as long as you do not attack it in an indirect manner by the interpretation of its laws, as long as you do not profoundly alter its substance, a change of opinion, an internal crisis, a war, could suddenly restore the vigor that it needs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3443">What I wanted to note is only this: many men among us think that in the United States there is a movement of minds that favors centralization of power in the hands of the President and Congress. I claim that an opposite <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>627<span class="bracket">]</span></span> movement is clearly observed. As the federal government grows older, far from gaining strength and threatening the sovereignty of the states, I say that it tends to become weaker each day, and that the sovereignty of the Union alone is in danger. That is what the present reveals. What will be the final result of this tendency, what events can stop, slow or hasten the movement that I have described? The future hides them, and I do not claim to be able to lift its veil.</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3449">[≠Dispersed over an immense and half empty<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1384" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1384_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">a</a> territory, the Americans have found themselves from the beginning divided into a great number of small distinct societies that were not naturally attached to a common center. <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>630<span class="bracket">]</span></span> So it was necessary that each one of these small societies took care of its own affairs, since nowhere did you see a central authority that could naturally provide for them. Town and provincial liberty were introduced to America by the English, but they arose there all by themselves by the very nature of things. Now, town and provincial liberty are the basis of [v: the only lasting foundation that you can give to] republican institutions and as long as they exist in the United States, the United States will remain republican.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3450">What is understood by republic in the United States is the slow and tranquil action of society on itself. It is an ordered state actually based on the enlightened will of the people. It is a conciliatory government, where resolutions mature over a long time, are debated slowly and are executed with maturity.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3451">Republicans in the United States value mores, respect beliefs, recognize rights. They profess this opinion, that a people must be moral, religious and moderate, in proportion as it is free. What is called a republic in the United States is the tranquil rule of the majority. The majority, after it has had the time to recognize itself and to take note of its existence, is the common source of powers. But the majority itself is not omnipotent. Above it in the moral world are found humanity, justice and reason; in the political world, vested rights. The majority recognizes these two barriers, and if it happens to cross them, it is because the majority has passions, like every man; and like him, it can do evil while perceiving good. [{For me, I will have no difficulty in saying, in all countries where the republic is practical, I will be republican.}]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3452">But we have made strange discoveries in Europe.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3453">According to some among us, the republic is not the rule of the majority, as we have believed until now; it is the rule of those who answer for the majority. It is not the people who lead these sorts of governments, but those who know the greatest good of the people: happy distinction, that allows acting in the name of nations without consulting them, and claiming their gratitude while trampling them underfoot.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1385" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1385_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">b</a> Republican government is, <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>631<span class="bracket">]</span></span> moreover, the only one in which the right to do everything must be recognized, and that can despise what men until now have respected, from the highest laws of morality to the ordinary rules of common sense.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3454">Until our time it had been thought that despotism was odious, whatever its forms. But it has been discovered in our day that there are legitimate tyrannies and holy injustices in the world, provided that they are exercised in the name of the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3455">[≠That is not a vague theory; they are maxims that are professed while basing them on facts. These doctrines have found ardent missionaries. I believe that I hear them saying to us:</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3456">You imagined, they say to us, that the republic was by its nature a free and tolerant government, and you thought perhaps that the trial that had formerly been made of it among us must not be imputed to the system itself, but to those who put it into practice and to the extraordinary circumstances in which this country found itself.≠]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1386" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1386_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">c</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3457">The ideas that the Americans have formed about the republic singularly facilitate its use for them and ensure that it will last.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1387" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1387_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">d</a> Among them, if the practice of republican government is often bad, at least the theory is good, and the people always finish by conforming their acts to it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3458">It was impossible in the beginning and it would still be very difficult in America to establish a centralized administration. Men are spread over too large a space and are separated by too many natural obstacles for one man to be able to undertake to direct the details of their existence. So America is par excellence the country of provincial and town government.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>632<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3459">To this cause, whose action made itself equally felt on all the Europeans of the New World, the Anglo-Americans added several others that are particular to them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3460">When the colonies of North America were established, municipal liberty had already penetrated English laws as well as mores, and the English emigrants adopted it not only as something necessary, but also as a good whose value they knew.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3461">[We have seen furthermore that in this matter the influence exercised by the country has been greater or lesser depending on the circumstances that accompanied colonization and the previously contracted habits of the colonists.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3462">The French carried to America the tradition of absolute monarchy; the English came there with the customs of a free people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3463">≠When the French arrived in Canada they first founded a city that they called Québec. From this city the population spread little by little by degrees, like a tree that spreads it roots in a circle. Québec has remained the central point, and the French of Canada are still today only one and the same people, submitted in most cases to one and the same government.≠</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3464">{It was not this way in the United States, above all in the part of the country that was called New England.}] We have seen, furthermore, how the colonies were founded. Each province and each district so to speak was populated separately by men strangers to one another, or associated for different ends.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3465">So the English of the United States found themselves from the beginning divided into a great number of small distinct societies that were attached to no common center, and it was necessary for each one of these small societies to take care of its own affairs, since nowhere did you see a central authority that naturally had to and easily could provide for them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3466">Thus the nature of the country, the very manner in which the English colonies were founded, the habits of the first emigrants, all united to develop town and provincial liberties there to an extraordinary degree.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3467">In the United States the institutions of the country are therefore as a whole essentially republican; to destroy in a lasting way the laws that established the republic, it would be necessary in a way to abolish all the laws all at once.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>633<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3468">If today a party undertook to establish a monarchy in the United States, it would be in a still more difficult position than whoever would want at the present moment to proclaim the republic in France. Royalty would not find legislation prepared for it in advance, and then in actual fact you would see a monarchy surrounded by republican institutions.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1388" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1388_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">e</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3469">The monarchical principle would penetrate with as much difficulty into the mores of the Americans.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3470">In the United States, the dogma of the sovereignty of the people is not an isolated doctrine that is attached neither to the habits nor to the ensemble of dominant ideas; you can on the contrary envisage it as the last link in a chain of opinions that envelops the entire Anglo-American world. Providence has given to each individual, what ever he is, the degree of reason necessary for him to be able to direct himself in the things that interest him exclusively. Such is the great maxim on which in the United States civil and political society rests: the father of the family applies it to his children, the master to his servants, the town to those it administers, the province to the town, the state to the provinces, the Union to the states. Extended to the whole of the nation, it becomes the dogma of the sovereignty of the people.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3471">[≠So the republican principle of the sovereignty of the people is not only a political principle, but also a civil principle.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3472">Thus in the United States the generative principle of the republic is the same one that regulates most human actions. So the republic, if I can express myself in this way, penetrates the ideas, the opinions and all the habits of the Americans at the same time that it is established in their laws; and in order to succeed in changing the laws, they would have to be changed wholesale as it were. In the United States the religion of the greatest number itself is republican; it subjects the truths of the other world to individual reason, as politics relinquishes to the good sense of all the responsibility for the interests of this one; and it agrees that each man should freely take the <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>634<span class="bracket">]</span></span> path that will lead him to heaven, in the same way that the law recognizes the right of each citizen to choose his government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3473">Clearly only a long series of facts, all having the same tendency, can substitute for this ensemble of laws, opinions and mores an ensemble of the opposite mores, opinions and laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3474">If the republican principles must perish in America, they will succumb only after a long social effort, frequently interrupted, often resumed; several times they will seem to arise again, and will disappear never to return only when an entirely new people will have taken the place of those who exist today. Now, nothing can portend such a revolution, no sign announces it.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3475">What strikes you the most on your arrival in the United States is the type of tumultuous movement in which political society is immersed. The laws change constantly, and at first view it seems impossible that a people so little sure of its will does not soon substitute for the present form of its government an entirely new form. These fears are premature. There are as regards political institutions two types of instability that must not be confused. The one is attached to secondary laws; that one can reign for a long time within a well-settled society. The other constantly shakes the very foundations of the constitution, and attacks the generative principles of the laws; this one is always followed by troubles and revolutions; the nation that suffers it is in a violent and transitory state. Experience demonstrates that these two types of legislative instability do not have a necessary link between them, for we have seen them exist conjoined or separately depending on times and places. The first is found in the United States, but not the second. The Americans frequently change the laws, but the foundation of the Constitution is respected.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3476">Today the republican principle reigns in America as the monarchical principle dominated in France under Louis XIV. The French of that time were not only friends of monarchy, but also they did not imagine that you could put anything in its place; they acknowledged it as you acknowledge the course of the sun and the vicissitudes of the seasons. Among them royal power had no more advocates than adversaries.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3477">This is how the republic exists in America, without struggle, without opposition, without proof, by a tacit agreement, a sort of <span class="ital">consensus universalis.</span></p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>635<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3478">Nonetheless, I think that by changing their administrative procedures as often as they do, the inhabitants of the United States compromise the future of republican government.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3479">Hampered constantly in their projects by the continual changeability of legislation, it is to be feared that men will end up considering the republic as an inconvenient way to live in society; the evil resulting from the instability of secondary laws would then put into question the existence of the fundamental laws, and would lead indirectly to a revolution. But this time is still very far from us.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3480">What you can foresee from now on is that by leaving the republic the Americans would pass rapidly to despotism, without stopping for a very long time at monarchy. Montesquieu said that there was nothing more absolute than the authority of a prince who followed a republic since the undefined powers that had been given without fear to an elective magistrate are then put into the hands of a hereditary leader.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1389" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1389_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">f</a> This is generally true but particularly applicable to a democratic republic. In the United States the magistrates are not elected by a particular class of citizens, but by the majority of the nation; they represent immediately the passions of the multitude, and depend entirely on its will; so they inspire neither hate nor fear. Also I have noted the little care that has been taken to limit their powers by tracing limits to its action, and what an immense share has been left to their arbitrariness. This order of things has created habits that would survive it. The American magistrate would keep his undefined power while ceasing to be responsible, and it is impossible to say where tyranny would then stop.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3481">[≠If Napoleon had followed Louis XIV, {he would have found royal power strong but surrounded by impediments that would have imposed limits on his spirit of domination} he would have shown himself more stable but not as absolute as he was. Napoleon following a representative of the people could do anything.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3482">There are men among us who are waiting to see aristocracy arise in America <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>636<span class="bracket">]</span></span> and who already foresee with exactitude the period when it must grasp power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3483">I have already said, and I repeat, that the current movement of American society seems to me more and more democratic.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3484">I do not claim, however, that one day the Americans will not end by restricting among themselves the circle of political rights, or by confiscating these very rights for the profit of one man; but I cannot believe that they will ever grant the exclusive use of those rights to a particular class of citizens or, in other words, that they will establish an aristocracy.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3485">An aristocratic body is composed of a certain number of citizens who, without being placed very far from the crowd, raise themselves nonetheless in a permanent manner above it; you touch and cannot strike them; you mix with them each day, and cannot merge with them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3486">It is impossible to imagine anything more contrary to the nature and to the secret instincts of the human heart than a subjugation of this type; left to themselves men will always prefer the arbitrary power of a king to the regular administration of nobles.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3487">In order to last an aristocracy needs to establish inequality in principle, to legalize it in advance, and to introduce it into the family at the same time that it spreads it throughout the society; all things that repulse natural equity so strongly that only by coercion can you obtain them from men.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3488">Since human societies have existed I do not believe that you can cite the example of a single people that, left to itself and by its own efforts, has created an aristocracy within itself; all the aristocracies of the Middle Ages are daughters of conquest. The conqueror was the noble, the conquered the serf. Force then imposed inequality, which once entered into the mores lasted by itself and passed naturally into the laws.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3489">You have seen societies that, because of events prior to their existence, are so to speak born aristocratic, and that are then led by each century back toward democracy. Such was the fate of the Romans, and that of the barbarians who came after them. But a people who, starting from civilization and democracy, would come closer by degrees to inequality of conditions, and would finish by establishing within itself inviolable privileges and exclusive categories, there is something that would be new in the world.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>637<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3490">Nothing indicates that America is destined to be the first to give such a spectacle.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3491">[≠I do not know if the Americans, like all peoples who have run the course before them, will end by submitting to one master, but I cannot believe that they will ever have a true aristocracy./</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3492">A party that undertook to establish monarchy in America today would find itself in as difficult a position as the one that wanted to proclaim the republic in France. In France you would implant the republican principle in the middle of secondary institutions that are still eminently monarchical. In America you would establish a king who would find in his hands only republican institutions.≠]</p>

<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3498">[≠Europe has no less need of the United States than the latter of Europe.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3499">The Union has products that have become necessary to us, and that our soil totally refuses to provide, or can do so only at great cost. The Americans consume only a very small part of these products; they sell us the rest.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3500">So Europe is the market of America, as America is the market of Europe; and maritime commerce is as necessary to the inhabitants of the United States in order to bring their raw materials to our ports as to transport our manufactured goods to them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3501">So the United States would have to provide great resources to the industry of maritime peoples, if they gave up commerce themselves, as the Spanish of Mexico have done until now; or they would have to become one of the premier maritime powers of the globe. This alternative was inevitable.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3502">The Anglo-Americans have at all times shown a decided taste for the sea. Independence, by breaking the commercial ties that united them to England, gave their maritime genius a new and powerful development. Since this period the number of ships of the Union has increased in a progression almost as rapid as the number of inhabitants. Today it is the Americans themselves who carry to their shores nine-tenths of the products of Europe.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1390" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1390_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">91</a> It is also <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>639<span class="bracket">]</span></span> the Americans who carry to European consumers three-quarters of the exports of the New World.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1392" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1392_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">92</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3503">The ships of the United States fill the port of Le Havre and that of Liverpool. You see only a small number of English or French vessels in the port of New York.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1393" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1393_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">93</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3504">Thus not only does the American merchant stand up to the competition on his own soil, but he also fights foreigners with advantage on theirs.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3505">This is easily explained. Of all the vessels of the world it is the ships of the United States that cross the seas most cheaply. As long as the merchant marine of the United States keeps this advantage over the others, not only will it keep what it has conquered, but each day it will increase its conquests.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3506">To know why the Americans sail at lower cost than other men is a difficult problem to solve. You are tempted at first to attribute this superiority to some material advantages that nature would have put within their reach alone; but it is not that.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3507">American ships cost almost as much to build as ours;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1394" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1394_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">94</a> they are not better constructed, and in general do not last as long.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3508">The salary of the American sailor is higher than that of the sailor of <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>640<span class="bracket">]</span></span> Europe; what proves it is the large number of Europeans that you find in the merchant marine of the United States.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1395" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1395_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">h</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3509">So how do the Americans sail more cheaply than we?</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3510">I think that you would look in vain for the causes of this superiority in material advantages; it is due to purely intellectual and moral qualities.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3511">Here is a comparison that will make my thought clear.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3512">During the wars of the Revolution the French introduced into military art a new tactic that troubled the oldest generals and all but destroyed the oldest monarchies of Europe. They undertook for the first time to do without a host of things that until then had been judged indispensable to war; they required from their soldiers new efforts that civilized nations had never demanded from theirs; you saw them do everything on the run, and without hesitating risk the life of men in view of the result to be gained.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3513">The French were less numerous and less rich than their enemies; they possessed infinitely fewer resources; they were constantly victorious, however, until the latter decided to imitate them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3514">The Americans introduced something analogous to commerce. What the French did for victory, they do for economy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1396" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1396_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">j</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3515">The European navigator ventures only with prudence onto the sea; he leaves only when the weather is inviting; if an unforeseen accident happens to him, he returns to port; at night he furls part of his sails, and when he <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>641<span class="bracket">]</span></span> sees the Ocean turn white as land nears, he slows his course and checks the sun.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3516">The American neglects these precautions and defies these dangers. He leaves while the storm is still raging; night and day he spreads all of his sails to the wind; while in route, he repairs his ship strained by the storm; and when he finally approaches the end of his journey, he continues to sail toward the shore as if he already saw port. [≠He often perishes, but even more often he reaches port before his competitors.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3517">The American is often shipwrecked;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1397" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1397_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">k</a> but no navigator crosses the sea as rapidly as he. [≠Of all men the American seems to me to be the one who has conceived the greatest and the most accurate idea of the value of time. There is no portion so small of day or night that does not have a value … in his eyes. He saves hours as the Dutch merchant saved capital. That is the secret of his success.≠] Doing the same things that someone else does in less time, he can do them at less cost.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3518">Before coming to the end of a long voyage, the European navigator believes that he must touch land several times on his way. He loses precious time looking for a port of call or awaiting the opportunity to leave one, and each day he pays the duty to remain there.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3519">The American navigator leaves from Boston to go to buy tea in China. He arrives in Canton, remains there a few days and comes back. He has covered in less than two years the entire circumference of the globe, and he has seen land only once. During a crossing of eight or ten months he has drunk brackish water and lived on salted meat; he has fought constantly against the sea, against disease, against boredom; but upon his return he can sell a pound of tea for one penny less than the English merchant. The goal is reached.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3520">I cannot express my thought better than by saying that the Americans put a kind of heroism in their way of doing commerce.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>642<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3521">[≠Heroism that is not only calculation, but also suggested by nature.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3522"><span class="ital">Natural</span> heroism that must give them not only the trade of America but make them carriers to nations.≠]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3523">It will always be very difficult for the merchant of Europe to follow the same course as his competitor from America. The American, while acting in the way I described above, is following not only a calculation; he is above all obeying his nature.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3524">The inhabitant of the United States experiences all the needs and all the desires to which an advanced civilization gives rise, and he does not find around him as in Europe a society skillfully organized to satisfy them; so he is often obliged to obtain by himself the various objects that his education and his habits have made necessary for him. In America it sometimes happens that the same man plows his field, builds his house, fashions his tools, makes his shoes and weaves by hand the crude fabric that has to cover him. This harms the perfection of industry, but serves powerfully to develop the intelligence of the worker. There is nothing that tends more to materialize man and remove from his work even the trace of soul than the great division of labor. [&lt;With the division of labor you do better and more economically what you already did, but you do not innovate. The division of labor is an element of wealth more than of progress.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3525">The art of dividing labor is the art of confiscating the intelligence of the greatest number for the profit of a few.&gt;]<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1398" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1398_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">m</a> In a country like America where <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>643<span class="bracket">]</span></span> specialized men are so rare, you cannot require a long apprenticeship of each one of those who take up a profession. So the Americans find it very easy to change profession, and they make the most of it, depending on the needs of the moment. You meet some of them who have been successively lawyers, farmers, merchants, evangelical ministers, doctors. If the American is less skillful than the European in each trade, there are hardly any of them that are entirely unknown to him. His ability is more general, the circle of his intelligence is wider. So the inhabitant of the United States is never stopped by any axiom of trade; he escapes all prejudices of profession; he is no more attached to one system of operation than to another; he does not feel more tied to an old method than to a new one; he has created no habit for himself, and he easily escapes from the sway that foreign habits could exercise over his mind, for he knows that his country resembles no other, and that its situation is new in the world [so he always follows his reason and never practice].</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3526">The American inhabits a land of wonders, around him everything is constantly stirring, and each movement seems to be an improvement. So the idea of the new is intimately linked in his mind to the idea of the better. Nowhere does he see the limit that nature might have put on the efforts of man; in his eyes what is not is what has not yet been attempted.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1399" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1399_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">n</a></p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3527">This universal movement that reigns in the United States, these frequent reversals of fortune, this unexpected displacement of public and private wealth, all join together to keep the soul in a sort of feverish agitation that admirably disposes it to all efforts, and maintains it so to speak above [itself and] the common level of humanity. For an American all of life happens like a game of chance, a time of revolution, a day of battle.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3528">These same causes, operating at the same time on all individuals, finish <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>644<span class="bracket">]</span></span> by stamping an irresistible impulse on the national character. So an American taken at random must be a man ardent in his desires, enterprising, adventurous, above all an innovator. This spirit is found in fact in all his works; he introduces it into his political laws, into his religious doctrines, into his theories of social economy, into his private industry; he carries it everywhere with him, deep in the woods, as well as within the cities. It is this same spirit applied to maritime commerce that makes the American sail more quickly and more cheaply than all the merchants of the world.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3529">As long as the sailors of the United States keep these intellectual advantages and the practical superiority that derives from them, not only will they continue to provide for the needs of the producers and consumers of their country, but also they will tend more and more to become, like the English,<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1400" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1400_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">95</a> the carriers of other peoples.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3530">This is beginning to be achieved before our eyes. Already we are seeing American sailors introduce themselves as middlemen in the commerce of several of the nations of Europe;<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1401" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1401_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">96</a> America offers them an even greater future.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3531">The Spanish and the Portuguese founded in South America great colonies that have since become empires. Civil war and despotism today desolate these vast countries. The population movement is stopping, and the small number of men who live there, absorbed by the concern of defending themselves, scarcely feel the need to improve their lot.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3532">But it cannot always be so. Europe left to itself managed by its own efforts to pierce the shadows of the Middle Ages; South America is Christian like us; it has our laws, our customs; it contains all the seeds of civilization that have developed within European nations and their offshoots; beyond what we had, South America has our example: why would it remain forever barbarous?</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>645<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3533">It is clearly only a question of time here. A more or less distant period will undoubtedly come when the South Americans will form flourishing and enlightened nations.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3534">But when the Spanish and the Portuguese of South America begin to experience the needs of civilized peoples, they will still be far from able to satisfy them themselves; newly born to civilization, they will be subject to the superiority already acquired by their elders. They will be farmers for a long time before becoming manufacturers and merchants, and they will need the intervention of foreigners in order to go and sell their products overseas and to obtain in exchange the objects whose necessity will now make itself felt.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3535">You cannot doubt that the Americans of North America are called one day to provide for the needs of the Americans of South America. Nature placed the first near the second. It thus provided the North Americans with great opportunities to know and estimate the needs of the South Americans, to strike up permanent relations with these peoples, and gradually to take possession of their market. The merchant of the United States could lose these natural advantages only if he was very inferior to the merchant of Europe; and he is, on the contrary, superior to him on several points. The Americans of the United States already exercise a great moral influence over all the peoples of the New World. From them comes enlightenment. All the nations that inhabit the same continent are already accustomed to considering them as the most enlightened, most powerful and wealthiest offshoots of the great American family. So they turn their view constantly toward the Union and they assimilate themselves, as much as it is within their power, to the peoples that compose it. Each day they come to draw political doctrines from the United States and borrow laws from them.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3536">The Americans of the United States are vis-à-vis the peoples of South America precisely in the same situation as their fathers, the English, vis-àvis the Italians, the Spanish, the Portuguese and all those peoples of Europe who, being less advanced in civilization and industry, receive from their hands most of the objects of consumption.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3537">England is today the natural center of commerce of nearly all the nations that are near it; the American Union is called to fulfill the same role in the other hemisphere. So every people that arises or that grows up in the New <span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>646<span class="bracket">]</span></span> World arises and grows up there in a way to the profit of the Anglo-American.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3538">If the Union came to break up, the commerce of the states that formed it would undoubtedly be slowed for some time in its development, but less than is thought. It is clear that whatever happens the commercial states will remain united. They all touch each other; among them there is a perfect identity of opinion, interests and mores, and alone they can make up a very great maritime power. Thus even if the South of the Union became independent of the North, the result would not be that it could do without the North. I said that the South is not commercial; nothing yet indicates that it must become so.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1402" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1402_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">[*]</a> So the Americans of the South of the United States will be obliged for a long time to resort to foreigners in order to export their products and to bring to them the objects that are necessary for their needs. Now of all the middlemen that they can take their neighbors of the North are surely those who can serve them more cheaply. So they will serve them, for the lowest price is the supreme law of commerce. There is no sovereign will or national prejudices that can struggle for long against the lowest price. You cannot see more venomous hatred than that which exists between the Americans of the United States and the English. In spite of these hostile sentiments, however, the English provide to the Americans most manufactured goods, for the sole reason that the English sell them for less than other peoples. The growing prosperity of America thus turns, despite the desire of the Americans, to the profit of the manufacturing industry of England.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>647<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3539">Reason shows and experience proves that no commercial greatness is lasting if it cannot be combined as needed with military power.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3540">This truth is as well understood in the United States as anywhere else. The Americans are already in the position of making their flag respected; soon they will be able to make it feared.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3541">I am persuaded that the dismemberment of the Union, far from diminishing the naval forces of the Americans, would tend strongly to increase them. Today the commercial states are linked to those that are not commercial, and the latter often go along only reluctantly with increasing a maritime power from which they profit only indirectly.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3542">If, on the contrary, all the commercial states of the Union formed only one and the same people, trade would become for them a national interest of the first order, so they would be disposed to make very great sacrifices to protect their ships, and nothing would prevent them from following their desires on this point.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3543">[In the present condition in which the affairs of the commercial world find themselves, there is no policy more naturally indicated than that of France.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3544">France is called to be always one of the great maritime powers, but she can never become the first except by chance. Since France cannot hope to dominate the sea in a lasting way, her visible interest is to prevent another from dominating there [v: to rise up against the domination of the sea] and to make the most liberal maxims as regards commerce prevail in the whole world.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3545">Even if the principle of the independence of neutral nations were not based on the right of nations, France should therefore still uphold it with all her strength. The independence of neutral nations is a guarantee against maritime tyranny, and France is the necessary champion of freedom of the seas.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3546">It is from this point of view that France is the natural enemy of England. She will always be so whatever you do, as long as England is able to impose its laws on the ocean.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3547">America is at present in a position analogous to that of France. It is powerful without being able to dominate; it is liberal because it cannot oppress.</p>
<span class="pb"><span class="decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class="bracket">[</span>648<span class="bracket">]</span></span>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3548">So America is the natural ally of France, in the same way that England is its enemy.<a href="#lf1593-01_footnote_nt1404" id="lf1593-01_footnote_nt1404_ref" class="footnote-link type-footnote">o</a> Everything that is done to the profit of the naval greatness of the United States is done in a way to the profit of France; for the maritime power of the Americans, by increasing, divides the dominion of the sea and gives to the French the liberty that they need.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3549">If maritime forces come to reach a balance between England and America, which will happen I think in a period that is not far away, the role of France will be, by going alternately to the side of the weaker, to prevent either one of them from entirely dominating the sea and thus to maintain liberty there.</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3550">But this balance itself will not be settled.]</p>
<p id="Tocqueville_1593-01_3551">I think that nations, like men, almost always show from their youth the principal features of their destiny. When I see in what spirit the Anglo-Americans manage commerce, the opportunities that they find for doing it, the successes that they achieve, I cannot keep myself from believing that one day they will become the premier maritime power of the globe. They are pushed to take possession of the seas, as the Romans to conquer the world.</p>
